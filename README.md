This is the repository for my Twitter Scraper Project.
I used a open source library: Twitter4J : http://twitter4j.org/

The library allowed me to access Twitter's API, and enabled me to write 
my own functions for gathering data through Java. I used this for my
Summer intern project, where I gathered Data on competitors Twitter accounts.

If you are intereseted in using my code, the documentation for the Twitter4J Library was very useful.

You can simpley download my code, and upload it as your own project into your favorite IDE. Make sure to edit
the properties file, with a valid Token from Twitter using your own account.

The current working code collects data from 2 pages of @SlackHQ, and quantifies the data into a few variables,
along with printing out the Tweets, Favorite Count, Username, and Retweet count. 

Note there are CSV files present, these files were used for storing the collected data.
