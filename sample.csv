Slack,0,0,@PavelLipcean There should be place for it when a team members edit their profile. 🤔 Are you seeing something else?
Slack,1,0,@MussarMusic 👋 Please drop us a note, we'll take a look: https://t.co/WeWXcwsZIU 💌
Slack,0,0,@hebinotoshi No option currently, sorry. 😔 But more customizable options for reminders is on our radar. 📝 Thanks for sharing! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@bscht No keyboard shortcuts?! 😱 Could you please write in so we can take a closer look? https://t.co/WeWXcwsZIU
Slack,0,0,@oliverbenns Oof. Sorry, Oliver. 😓 We're working on reducing Slack's footprint. Please bear with us. 🚧
Slack,0,0,@jeffweisbein Yikes! Apologies, Jeff! Please drop us a note so we can get you back online: feedback@slack.com ⚡️
Slack,0,0,@taka_dhu Oh boy, that's strange! Does your time zone look correct? 👉 Click your team name, then Preferences > Language & Region.
Slack,0,0,@Dan17894652 Hmm, the folks in the Melbourne office tell us it could also mean 'smart casual trousers'. Interesting! 🤔💭👖
Slack,0,0,@mons00n It can take up to 24 hours to see the change reflected on the statistics page. Please hang tight! 🏄
Slack,0,0,@BrianKFrancis Oh, lovely! 🙌 Let us know if there's anything else we can give you a hand with. 🎈
Slack,0,0,@jeffweisbein 😬Uh-oh, we're sorry for the trouble. Are you using Slack in a browser or a desktop app? Can you connect in Chrome Incognito?
Slack,2,0,@SQLRockstar Hi there, we're sorry this isn't your preference. You're not alone with this request, and we'll note the continued interest ✍😄
Slack,15,1,@alex_persian We knew we had to limit reactions to avoid clutter and encourage creativity, and 23 seemed like a nice prime number.¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Slack,0,0,@_RGT12_ Very kind of you to say so! 🐝
Slack,0,0,@BrianKFrancis Oh no! We'd like to look into this further - can you drop us a line at feedback@slack.com? 📝👀
Slack,1,0,@_RGT12_ We hear you! In fact, this is something we're looking to improve in the future. 🔮
Slack,0,0,@mattcen Hello! Anything we can help with?
Slack,2,0,@JSn1nj4 We hear you — thanks for the feedback 🙇
Slack,1,0,@JohnRichDesign 📝🙌
Slack,0,0,@apiousman 🤣 (and yes!)
Slack,0,0,@kersten_broich That's so good to hear — thanks!
Slack,0,0,@apiousman We've no ETA to share just yet, but we're working on it 🙌
Slack,0,0,@OhNoItsFusl But we've shared your feedback with the team — sorry again for the annoyance 🙌
Slack,0,0,@OhNoItsFusl We're really sorry for the frustration. We're now showing some info sooner rather than waiting longer to show all of it.
Slack,1,0,@nabinno Sorry about that! Do you mind dropping us a line about this? https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,1,0,@noboundsdigital More info: https://t.co/ZpsIvgDWDo
Slack,1,0,@noboundsdigital Btw, you can choose what channels are imported at the import stage.
Slack,0,0,@petebocken Sorry about that! We'll let the team know this is something you'd like. Thanks 🙌
Slack,2,0,@bikehugger @mathowie You should see what he can do on a penny-farthing…
Slack,0,0,@KhayaMaloney Sorry for the frustration! Heavy in what way?
Slack,1,0,@ryaneshea Thanks so much for flagging this. Please write in with details if you haven't already: https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,0,0,@86era Sorry about that! Do you mind writing in so we can explore this in more detail? https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,0,0,@melomap We retired the web archive view — sorry for any confusion. Archives should be viewable in-app, though!
Slack,0,0,@robyn_ravenclaw You should be able to share a link to a GIF and have it display in channel — does that help?
Slack,0,0,@char_fish We'd like to investigate this further. Would you mind writing us at feedback@slack.com? Thanks!
Slack,1,0,@noboundsdigital We hear you, Ben. We're looking to improve this process. If you hit any walls, email us at feedback@slack.com.
Slack,0,0,@w00tyLab  We don't have this option just yet! Sorry about that. We are working to make improvements in this area! 🙏
Slack,1,0,@chadsipes  Sensible idea! We'll pass it along. 👌
Slack,5,0,@darcylou  Oh dear! We are investigating this bug as we speak. Thank you for your patience and sorry for the scare. 👻
Slack,1,0,@octal Ah! We see what you mean. We’ll pass the idea along! ⭐
Slack,3,0,@OtyMartin 😎 We hear you, Martin! Your feedback has been duly noted. 📝
Slack,0,0,@HeatherSmithAU Yup! For security reasons, you will have to sign into all teams.
Slack,0,0,@andymadge If any were directed to Private Channels, you will have to re-create them. 😬
Slack,0,0,@andymadge As an Admin/Owner, you should be able to re-enable any integrations pointing to Public Channels here: https://t.co/ZpLTzsB134
Slack,1,0,@TheTannerRyan @kilodelta You sure can! Just visit our Slack Shop: https://t.co/vhPGzZ7F7D 🙌
Slack,0,0,@86era 🤔 Hmm. Does it work for you in other apps? Can you also try powering down and then restarting. Thanks!
Slack,1,0,@octal Sure thing! Tell us more about what you mean when you say 'locking down a channel,' and we'll see if there's anything to suggest. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@NotBabafemi We hear you, Femi. We'll relay this feedback to the team for you. Thanks for sharing! 🙌
Slack,0,0,@tennyson1842 Possibly! We'd love to take a closer look, just in case. Can you drop us a line at feedback@slack.com. Thank you, Michael! 👀🔍
Slack,1,0,@duellsy Many, many little Slack helpers! 👩🏻‍💻👨🏻‍💻👩🏾‍💻👨🏿‍💻👩‍💻👨‍💻
Slack,1,0,@benhaynes That's certainly an idea! We aren't currently planning on this, but it's food for thought. Thanks!
Slack,1,0,@idftech Hey thanks! 😘
Slack,0,0,@tennyson1842 Oh no! Can we ask which browser you are using? If you try an incognito or private browser, does that work?
Slack,0,0,@tennyson1842 Can you try this help test, and send us the results when it's finished? https://t.co/X1Uo3T8GP5
Slack,0,0,@tennyson1842 Oh dear! We're not seeing troubles on our side: are you getting an error message you could share with us?
Slack,0,0,@lelandf Hmmm, do you have more than 1 team signed in? Could there be an unread DM or mention in a secondary team perchance?
Slack,0,0,@duncanjeremy Sadly, that is an ongoing issue the team is working on. So sorry for the inconvenience! 🙌
Slack,0,0,@caolantweets Sorry for the bad news there 😞  We'll share your feedback with our team to give more thought to.
Slack,0,0,@ultimape Oh dear, that looks like a reminder set by one of the users on your team. Please contact your team admin and let them know!
Slack,0,0,@jedahan You can always send through a note to our team via https://t.co/WeWXcwsZIU when you have a chance, and our team will dig in! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@mittense Ooh we see what you mean. We've heard some folks have tried remapping their Esc key— is that something you've tried at all?
Slack,1,0,@Kraft @Folletto Yup! Electron is the base we use for the Windows, Mac, and Linux client ✨
Slack,1,0,@jamiefeedback We see what you mean and we'll be happy to pass this on. 💖
Slack,0,0,@caolantweets We recently retired the message archives. We can seamlessly load links now directly in the app.
Slack,0,0,@mittense Yes indeed! You can use `Shift+esc` to mark all channels in a team as read.
Slack,1,0,@icastanheda It is! Tap the message you'd like to reply to, and type a reply. 📱
Slack,0,0,@jedahan Where are you seeing a mandatory field like that? Could you send a screenshot?
Slack,0,0,@mikejimlarry No, that's not possible, sorry.
Slack,0,0,@sarahhalle Campaign? Are we running for election? No one told us! We should probably go by suits.
Slack,0,0,@erinlauraoneil 🤔 Please write to feedback@slack.com with the team details so we can take a closer look into this.
Slack,0,0,@OhNoItsFusl We're very sorry. We're working to speed thing up so all information in a channel loads more quickly.
Slack,0,0,@calebsboyd Thanks!
Slack,1,0,@crouhana We're afraid it's not possible to do so at this time; sorry for any inconvenience this causes!
Slack,0,0,@TylerJBunnell ...apologies! Our team is aware of it and working on this issue 🙏 2/2
Slack,0,0,@TylerJBunnell Ah, gotcha. We do have a known issue where calls use discrete, and the app doesn't switch after the call ends. Our... 1/2
Slack,0,0,@TylerJBunnell Sorry about this, Tyler! Is this after placing a call in Slack by chance?
Slack,0,0,@calebsboyd Could you send your team details and some specific example URLs to feedback@slack.com? We'll take a closer look into this.
Slack,0,0,@thats_so_neil Oh no! What a jumbled up way to start your weekend. Can you try refreshing (Cmd + R) to see if that helps?
Slack,0,0,@icywolfy We're terribly sorry for the frustrating experience. Does Ctrl + R or Cmd + R help at all?
Slack,2,0,@SeanJA 👋 With a quick refresh, this should be fixed! And thank goodness, it was driving our writers up a wall.
Slack,0,0,@mybeachisbetter Ah! Please drop us a note so we can see what might be possible. feedback@slack.com 🙌
Slack,1,0,@pmenonb  😔  You're running into a bug that our team is working to tackle. Deleting and then reinstalling the app should fix this for you.
Slack,1,0,@Folletto Noted. Please know we'll share this with the team over here. 👉
Slack,1,0,@houstongraham No timeline to give you yet. Perhaps we do need to reorganize our priorities 😅 . Thanks for your patience!
Slack,0,0,@ProfessorTom There isn't a way to mute a channel for a specified time. That is a very good idea though! We'll make note it for you. 📝
Slack,0,0,@hatsharpener Sorry about that! 😅 Threads within a public channel are visible to anyone on the team if they click into them.
Slack,1,0,@kenliecer ¡Gracias Kenneth! Quizás algún día. 💖
Slack,0,0,@Indie_Intern That is not ideal. 😅 Please drop a note to feedback@slack.com and we'll help you out.
Slack,0,0,@ceo_or_bust It is? Can you share a screenshot of what that looks like? We're at feedback@slack.com if you prefer.
Slack,0,0,@realdarthdoesmc The bulk delete feature no longer exists, following the removal of the message archives pages. Sorry about that. ☹️
Slack,0,0,@calebsboyd  🤔 Is it unfurling in your team despite being blacklisted, or would you like it to not unfurl for everyone's teams?
Slack,0,0,@jonathansywulak Thanks for letting us know! We'll let our Platform team know this would be a major time-saver for you. 🚀
Slack,0,0,@allhailqueenbie 👍🏿👍🏾👍🏽👍🏼👍🏻✨
Slack,0,0,@paniolo08 No, this is new to us. Could you please go to https://t.co/5gmpOHU2Rn and send the results to Support? We'll investigate!
Slack,0,0,@tyler_warnecke There’s no upper limit, but you may not have the most ideal experience with several thousand members.
Slack,0,1,@iamVP7 We don't have an all-at-once option, but we'd be happy to email you a list of all your teams: https://t.co/oUb433Gxi1 💌
Slack,0,0,@tyler_warnecke It's not possible to have just anyone join a team, but there are a few options available: https://t.co/1ypdIh3WFV.
Slack,0,0,@_siddheshM We hear you — we're working hard to get thing back to normal.
Slack,1,0,@melboyce Well spotted! Thanks, we'll let our documentation crew know. 🌟
Slack,0,0,@j0hnluke Interesting, we'll share it with the team! We don't have that, but maybe something in our App Directory?: https://t.co/tNULINngLT
Slack,1,0,@lukebrewster Thanks for the kind words, Luke! There are no firm plans for this at the moment, but this is a great suggestion.
Slack,0,0,@SirDugs Custom slash commands can be configured to send GET requests, but App commands cannot. Sorry!
Slack,1,0,@jamesleebennett It’s not currently on the roadmap, but we’ll consider it for the future. Thanks for the suggestion! 🎈
Slack,0,0,@maslowbeer Alas, no — we understand this is frustrating for you. It’s not currently on the roadmap, but we’ll consider it for the future.
Slack,0,0,@SeanJA Very strange! We'll let the team know and investigate — thanks for letting us know!
Slack,1,0,@derfleck Alas, no, it's only possible to activate it for a day at the moment — we are exploring the options, however.
Slack,0,0,@ntcoding Thank you for these thoughts — we'll pass them to the team, and look into how it can be improved!
Slack,0,0,@SeanJA Just to confirm, could you let us know where you're seeing this? Is it a timestamp for a message posted in a channel?
Slack,13,0,@Hacker0x01 🍔🍔🍔
Slack,0,0,@SirDugs Ah, we get you now! App icons need to be squares, so that seems to be the problem with your image.
Slack,0,0,@ntcoding We're sorry it's not working for you at the moment, but we're taking all feedback on board. What seems to be the problem?
Slack,0,0,@SirDugs Strange! What exactly are you seeing when you try to upload it, and what app and version are you using?
Slack,0,0,@SeanJA Oops, thanks for flagging this to us Sean! 🙈
Slack,1,0,@hersh_amin Ah, we hear you. It’s not currently on the roadmap, but we’ll consider this for the future.
Slack,0,0,@j0hnluke Hmm, do you mean inspirational loading messages, or just daily inspirational messages for your team?
Slack,0,0,@aleximj Hmm, you should be able to! What seems to be happening for you? 🤔
Slack,1,0,@hersh_amin Is there anything in particular that is causing problems?
Slack,1,0,@DomStich That's it! A gentle tap. 😄
Slack,1,0,@DomStich You can start a thread following these steps: tap on the message, then tap on Start a thread and press return. 🙌
Slack,1,0,@dblencowe Oh, sorry for the trouble! Do you mind writing us a report at https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X? 🙏
Slack,0,0,@juter Sorry about that Justin! Do you mind sending us a report using the slash command /feedback? Our team will look into this. 🙏
Slack,0,0,@P_BrianMackey Ah excellent! Glad to hear we found a solution. 🙌
Slack,0,0,@sfhosley We'll certainly relay that feedback to the team for you :)
Slack,0,0,@thomasdegry Thanks so much - we will take a look into it more closely for you now.
Slack,0,0,@thomasdegry Could you please try this test and forward the results to /feedback: https://t.co/fHDQCFxYhG we will dig further! Thanks 2/2
Slack,0,0,@thomasdegry It shouldn't cause any problems that you're connecting from Europe. 1/2
Slack,0,0,@thomasdegry We've not had other reports of this thus far. Are others on your network experiencing the same issue?
Slack,0,0,@Js41637 We pull this from the page's meta data. Might be good feedback for that site? 📜
Slack,0,0,@seanjreilly The bug has remained open and no full fix has been confirmed just yet but do bear with us and will get this done asap! 🙏
Slack,0,0,@danjessen Great, thanks for keeping us posted and do let us know if you have further trouble. 🙏
Slack,1,0,@Foxandxss Sorry for this trouble. That's due to a bug we're currently investigating and working to resolve. We hope you can bear with us 🙏
Slack,0,0,@danjessen Then let us know if you see any improvements there? Thanks so much and sorry again! 2/2
Slack,0,0,@danjessen It should but we had some issue with it in recent updates, Apologies. Can you try the latest version  https://t.co/S1sb16v6dA 1/2
Slack,0,0,@danjessen Sorry for all this trouble. Could you please go to help > show logs in finder and forward them to /feedback so we can look? 🙏
Slack,0,0,@anupriyako If so, would you mind dropping us a line? https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,0,0,@anupriyako Sorry about that! Do you still see this if you refresh your team with Ctrl/Cmd R?
Slack,0,1,@bscht Afraid this bug is still ongoing 😏 So sorry about that, we hope to have it resolved very soon. Thanks for bearing with us 🤗
Slack,0,0,@seanjreilly Sorry about that! This is a known issue — but thanks for the nudge 🙌
Slack,0,0,@danjessen Hmm, can you please restart the app by pressing Cmd + Q and then reopen Slack. Let me know if that brings them back for you! 🤞
Slack,0,0,@martinbeentjes 2/2...on your team use them. We'll share your message as a feature request with the team in charge of custom statuses. ✍️
Slack,0,0,@martinbeentjes We did consider animated emojis for status updates but we decided that it could be very distracting if lots of users...1/2
Slack,0,0,@tariqrauf Thanks for the feedback! We'll pass it along to the team here for consideration down the line 🤞
Slack,0,0,@lexandermygind Great, thank you! Can you also please confirm if it works ok for them in a browser?
Slack,0,0,@domurtag Hmmm sorry about this. Would you mind writing to us at feedback@slack.com so that we can investigate this issue further? Thanks! 🙏
Slack,1,0,@lexandermygind Is this happening on Mac or Windows? Can they check that they are on the latest version of the app: https://t.co/RvUnYTicJJ
Slack,1,0,@OddChirp Hey! Thanks for taking time out to report it. You can send details to feedback@slack.com. 🙇🏻‍♀️
Slack,0,0,@ShajanSheriff Hmm, that seems strange. Mind writing in to feedback@slack.com so we can take a closer look?
Slack,0,0,@sarahspoon 🙌
Slack,0,0,@WorcsWebStudio Sadly, we don't have a way to bulk delete messages at the moment. We are all ears for feedback on this change.👂
Slack,0,0,@EthanSzcz1 🙌🌸
Slack,0,0,@lexandermygind Eep, what seems to be happening for them?
Slack,1,0,@avizuber Nothing wrong with it at all, it's perfectly good! It was unrelated inadvisable googling that lead to 😑.
Slack,0,0,@xSaplingIV 😨🙉🤗💖
Slack,5,1,@desantis @jk_rowling @nickabouzeid Surely there are some levitating businessmen working in the Ministry of Magic, no?
Slack,1,0,@soniagupta504 Not this time. ✨
Slack,1,0,@kyletothejones One little spoiler, and then we'll be done:

The sun comes up. 👯
Slack,1,0,@netweb Nice! Happy Open Source Friday!
Slack,9,1,@nickabouzeid @desantis  We just realized that Webdings is 20 years old. So is Harry Potter! Coincidence? 🤔🤔🤔
Slack,0,0,@peterchaly Oh, we're on the lookout. 😼
Slack,1,0,@mittense Sorry about that, and thanks for the report! We'll look into it. (We think we see the issue.)
Slack,1,0,@makerspherehq That's an overload of cuteness! 🙈🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱
Slack,0,0,@ShajanSheriff Hm, sorry about this. What macOS and Slack app is this occurring on?
Slack,0,0,@jvusa You've done all the hard work, the least we can do is give you a tractor?! 😉✨🚜
Slack,3,1,@desantis ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Slack,0,0,@emily_kellert 😍✌️💖🌍
Slack,1,0,@MiraDarkblood 🐋🌊🏄🌊🌊🌊🐙🌊🌊🚣🌊🌊
Slack,5,1,@purana We have offices in alllllll the capital cities of Victoria. Including this one.
Slack,1,0,@makerspherehq ... and 🐶? 😽
Slack,0,0,@Bizzycola3 All except this tiny duckling. The duckling knows what's up. https://t.co/eVa56t5bps
Slack,8,0,@Bizzycola3 We tried that one and just got a gif of a cat on a Roomba.
Slack,6,0,@joebe4rd What's the phobia you didn't know you had until you searched for it to find out what it was? It's that one.
Slack,1,0,@helloawestrich What a great way to spend your Saturday! 🕹 Enjoy the weekend!
Slack,2,0,@dloehr 🎈✨🏂💖🍩🎵
Slack,1,0,@maxinelines 😘🐰
Slack,62,3,Retraction: our emoji of the day just changed to 😑 after a regrettable Google search. We apologize for the error.
Slack,54,3,In SlackHQ Melbourne today, our emoji of the day is 🕴. Yours?

(PS — Hi! Happy Friday!)
Slack,0,0,@SavingPrincess We hear ya! There's no firm plans, but we'll keep your use case in mind!
Slack,0,0,@sfhosley Ah, we recently replaced the progress bar with the spinner. Thanks for letting us know — we'll share your messages with the team.
Slack,0,0,@0x71 As much as we'd love some extra cash, we're afraid we currently have no plans to increase this limit. Sorry!
Slack,0,0,@benwdwd Afraid we don't support consolidated logins across teams for security & administrative reasons. Sorry for the frustration!
Slack,1,0,@aaronorosen We hear you! No ETA, but we're exploring both image/file threads. We'll let the team know you're keen!
Slack,0,0,@jay_peg Hmm, 🤔 that's quite strange, sorry! Would you mind writing in? We'd love to dig into this further with you. https://t.co/KsR6mZY2hf
Slack,0,0,@JohnZimmerman Lucky we didn't write it down in pen. 😅 Note amended! 📝
Slack,0,0,@chrislorensson ✨🏄🎈
Slack,2,0,@keranm @girlie_mac Oh, yay! We're glad you two met up after all! 🍿
Slack,0,0,@sfhosley (You can check that by swiping left in Slack > Settings > About.)
Slack,0,0,@sfhosley We received a few similar reports a while back, but we believe this issue to be fixed. Which version of Slack for iOS are you on?
Slack,0,0,@sfhosley Got it. Are you using the Slack desktop app, or web browser? Mac or Windows? If you're accessing Slack via browser, which one?
Slack,0,0,@mattbettinson 😂 😇
Slack,0,0,@sfhosley Oh, that's unusual. There should actually be a progress bar along the top of the channel. Do you see a green bar along the top?
Slack,0,0,@B_Meson Thanks so much! 🙇🏻
Slack,0,0,@B_Meson Okay! Could you please update to our latest version, 2.6.3, from https://t.co/GCw7YxxgIh? We have a feeling this will fix things!
Slack,4,0,@dubstrike You are ever-so-welcome.
Slack,0,0,@brenolf_ Sorry, we don't have any updates on this particular feature. It's not currently prioritized on our roadmap, we're afraid. 🤕
Slack,2,1,@TheClaudacity We hear carrier pigeons were all the rage. 🐦
Slack,0,0,@JohnZimmerman Noted! We agree, that would be a helpful addition. 📝
Slack,0,0,@jay_peg 😓 Ah, Mac or Windows? Slack *should* open links in your computer's default browser. You changed this at the system level, correct?
Slack,0,0,@B_Meson Yikes. Are you on the Mac or Windows app? Does the font size change permanently, or is it a temporary thing?
Slack,0,0,@sfhosley Ow, sorry about that! You're noticing that it's taking a while to load your status when you change it, yes?
Slack,0,0,@cdiersing Oh! Like, as in, emoji reaction? You can add custom emoji from https://t.co/VwJXlFZv8s, then you can react with that emoji. 😉
Slack,1,0,@GetSlingshot Nice idea! For now, you can paste the hex codes into your internal DM, then click the button to apply them quickly. 🎨
Slack,0,0,@hksperl Hmmmm! Could any of these be the app you're looking for? https://t.co/EUNbOKJYQj 😅
Slack,0,0,@G33kyGills Oh no! Are you missing notifications on your watch? Or is the entire interface not working anymore?
Slack,0,0,@cinnabar3 Oh, afraid not. If it's being used in a specific unhelpful manner, you might try talking to your team and your admins about it!
Slack,3,0,@anildash 😅👋✨
Slack,0,0,@willcharczuk Oh, uploaded .webm files should auto-expand like you'd expect, but properly unfurling .webm links are also on our list! 🎉
Slack,0,0,@gauravphoenix Well, drat. In that case, would you be able to drop feedback@slack.com a line so we can dig deeper into what's going wrong? 💌
Slack,0,0,@B_Meson Hrmm, odd. Is that happening in both a browser and one of our desktop apps? Does it change size while you have the channel open? 🤔
Slack,0,0,@ryanvarick Right! Makes sense to us. ✨📣
Slack,0,0,@rmgenson Oh, no, sorry to say that's a known issue with the app, Rachael. It's on our radar, though, and we're hoping to fix it up soon! 🐛
Slack,0,0,@vyscond We’re exploring this idea, so stay tuned! 🎶
Slack,0,0,@billhelm  Sorry for the trouble! It’s not currently on the roadmap, but we’ll consider it for the future. Thanks for the suggestion! 🙏
Slack,1,0,@schultetonya  You’re making us blush! 😍
Slack,2,0,@adriana_howell  Cheers! 🍹🙌
Slack,0,0,@vykromond We've made some changes to how archives are launched, but the links should work in your browser from IRC.
Slack,0,0,@evolvability A team admin can turn on the "shuffle" feature for Giphy. That way you can decline to post gifs you don't like.
Slack,0,0,@kirabug That's no good! Please get in touch at feedback@slack.com and our iOS team will take a look.
Slack,0,0,@gauravphoenix 🤔 Can you try refreshing the app and see if you get the same result?
Slack,1,0,@agisilaosts We're sorry for the trouble. Better offline, low-bandwidth, and intermittent connection support are all planned.
Slack,0,0,@ryanvarick Sorry, not sure we understand. You want different preferences for DM notifications than you have for channels?
Slack,0,0,@topikito  Also, you can disable rich media in Preferences > Messages & Media > Inline Messages & Links.
Slack,0,0,@topikito We have another tip to share! Try typing /collapse to minimize animated gifs and rich media in channels. 👍
Slack,0,0,@ryanvarick Certainly! In the DM, click the Settings cog button > Notification preferences > All new messages. 👍
Slack,2,0,@DP_CyberCrime No immediate plans to change this, but thank you for the suggestion. We'll share it with the team. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@DP_CyberCrime That is the minimum length, but we recommend following this handy guide for creating safe passwords: https://t.co/xrPTvjaSkY
Slack,0,0,@vasuchawla Ah, afraid it's not possible right now, but it's a great suggestion. We'll share it with the team!
Slack,0,0,@goldiesquats Oooh. We don't have it yet, but the API is there if you're interested in building it! https://t.co/7ricUn6DcJ
Slack,1,0,@ALR42 That's an idea! 💡Thanks for sharing this with us! 👍
Slack,0,0,@erinlauraoneil 🤔 Are you trying to delete a private channel perhaps? At this time, it's only possible to archive private channels.
Slack,0,0,@sarahspoon It shouldn't, sorry. Can you go to iOS Settings > Slack > enable Reset Cache on Next Launch > let us know if a re-launch helps?
Slack,0,0,@notthatnathan Super weird. Glad to hear it's fixed, but do let us know if it happens again. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Slack,1,0,@benwiley4000 Fair! We'll pass your feedback along to the team.
Slack,1,0,@patleeman Ah gotcha! Yep, it's custom alright!
Slack,0,0,@ChrisCharabaruk We see what you mean there! Thanks for the suggestion too. We'll pass this along. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@bvhme We feel it’s important that work teams have a channel where everyone can be reached! If you like, you can mute the channel! 💡
Slack,1,0,@john_fisherman That's really good feedback! We'll look into making that better. Thanks for sharing!
Slack,0,0,@topikito 😕 We're working on improvements in this area. For now, restarting Slack may help!
Slack,0,0,@sarahspoon 😭 Which version of Slack you're using? We'll look into this.
Slack,4,0,@BenRCongdon Could be indeed 🤔. We'll pass your thoughts along!
Slack,0,0,@mattvogt Hmm… are you on Windows perhaps? There's a bug we're looking into around shift-esc at the moment.
Slack,1,0,@EricMarkDo 🌈✨
Slack,0,0,@elbutler Hmm… definitely sounds like a bug. Would you mind dropping a line to feedback@slack.com with some details?
Slack,0,0,@gmcconnaughey 💡 That's an idea! We'll give this some thought. 😃
Slack,0,0,@benwiley4000 We appreciate the feedback! If it helps at all, it also puts in a modifier limiting the search to your current channel.
Slack,1,0,@kplanz Haven't planned on it, no, but we're keeping our options open for the future. Thanks for letting us know how it's running for you! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@thenameisnat0 Ah! Yes, we're afraid that isn't going to work. Sorry about this! You'll need to contact a team Owner or Admin to join. 🎈
Slack,0,0,@AsherDeVuyst You're too kind! (We hope we're not failing too often, though!) 🌈🌲
Slack,1,0,@rafaelderolez Ah yes, that would be one of the quirks of Hangouts emoji! We're sorry that we can't make the labels match this set better.
Slack,1,0,@GroundControl They're coming! We're hoping to add the iOS 10 batch soon. Sorry about the delay! 🐙✨
Slack,0,0,@JoshAllegro Still every 5 minutes! (Is that not what you're experiencing, though? Let us know if you're having trouble!) 🍦
Slack,0,0,@Eva_CdA Thanks! We have a soft spot in our hearts for that old @playglitch forest. 🐖🌈🌲💖
Slack,0,0,@ikB3N No bribes required, just a bit of API finagling! Our blog has some basic instructions to get you started: https://t.co/l4y7jxI435
Slack,0,0,@PhillippOh 🙌
Slack,0,0,@username081 Thanks for writing in — one of our specialists is taking a look and will be in touch via email asap.
Slack,0,0,@PhillippOh Ooh, that's not ideal! If you drop us a line to feedback@slack.com we can take a closer look for you! 🙏
Slack,1,0,@laurahannawhite Alas, after the Battle of Dustball Gulch, we’re no longer allowed to have sticks at work, dusty or otherwise.
Slack,0,0,@username081 Hmm, if you drop us a line to feedback@slack.com we'll take a closer look at the situation!
Slack,0,0,@username081 From the screenshot it looks as though that's a reminder sent by someone else on the team, so your Team Owners can take action.
Slack,0,0,@FactDeJour Phew, glad to hear it! On the latest version (v2.6.3) you should also be able to use the right-click option. ✨
Slack,0,0,@NimaiMalle Ah, that's a good point. We'll definitely think about it! 🌸
Slack,0,0,@FactDeJour Oh no! What exactly are you seeing — is this using the right click menu or cmd/ctrl + v?
Slack,1,0,@adrianorbs Thanks for the suggestion — much appreciated 🙌
Slack,1,0,@JeffGlueck Sorry for the trouble! Would you mind sending us details of the problems you're seeing? https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,4,0,@HannahOmid @dens We know it's not the best experience right now, sorry! It's an Electron issue we're looking at. 🐛
Slack,0,0,@joewalshrocks Oof, not ideal! Thanks for letting us know about this — it's certainly something for us to consider.
Slack,0,0,@dtuite We hear you, and are exploring how reminders can be improved, so stay tuned! 📻
Slack,1,0,@fhendrie Gotcha. It’s not currently on the roadmap, but (for the Jensen gif) we’ll consider it for the future. ✨
Slack,0,0,@astroaware More info! https://t.co/npkXTJjKGy
Slack,0,0,@astroaware You can pin Posts to channels, and share them so they're editable by all 📝👩‍👩‍👧‍👧📌
Slack,0,0,@fhendrie Groups as in kinda sorta like folders, do you mean?
Slack,1,0,@ndxcc Cripes — sorry about that! Could you drop us a line so we can look into things? https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,0,0,@joewalshrocks Oh dear — it isn't — sorry about that! We'll note for the team that there are visual differentiation issues here.
Slack,0,0,@tdmalone But we certainly take the feedback on board. Sorry for the frustration 🙌
Slack,1,1,@tdmalone Sorry for the delay! No, it wasn't something we announced. We reason most people will want to do things in Slack…
Slack,0,0,@timjreynolds Sorry about that! Does refreshing your team with Ctrl/Cmd R help? Please drop us a line if not: https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,0,0,@joewalshrocks Hello! No, alas! But an Admin can change the team icon, if that's the icon you mean: https://t.co/AVAi3UnNT9
Slack,1,0,@Brammm You can't, but it's an interesting idea — thanks! 🤔🙇‍♀️
Slack,0,0,@godling_zlm Not ideal, but you could temporarily zoom with Ctrl/Cmd = 🤔 (And you can return to default zoom with Ctrl/Cmd 0)
Slack,0,0,@Gyunlim Oh sorry — misunderstood! There isn't — sorry about that 🙌
Slack,0,0,@evilneuro That's so good to hear … on balance 😅🙌😱
Slack,0,0,@roccetry This isn't on our immediate roadmap, sorry — but we'll certainly note your feedback for the team 🙌
Slack,0,0,@Gyunlim Might just be a case of talking to a Team Owner or Admin to get this created, depending on team settings 👍
Slack,1,2,@vineetkaul Oh! On desktop, if you go to Preferences > Messages & Media > and untick the 'Convert Emoticons' option, does that help things?
Slack,2,0,@z_anderle Ah, so sorry, Žan. We're afraid that's the case for now. We know there's a lot to improve when it comes to managing many teams. 😔
Slack,0,0,@patleeman Thanks for the love! Is this the new input on mobile apps? We can't reveal too much, but we really appreciate the feedback!
Slack,0,0,@alpennec 💖
Slack,0,0,@I_am_Dan_Ellis So sorry, Dan. This is a known issue that we're hoping to fix as quickly as possible. Having to read it 10 times is no good.
Slack,1,0,@alpennec 👋 Mind asking this question through feedback@slack.com? We'll be able to explain better without the character limit!
Slack,0,0,@username081 We'd recommend speaking to your Team Owners or Admins, but we're always available at feedback@slack.com or /feedback.
Slack,0,0,@teppo You got it. Thanks for your patience! 🙇
Slack,1,1,@big_roof Any time! 🐻
Slack,0,0,@notthatnathan Ah, in Slack, click 'Slack' in the top toolbar, then 'About Slack'. Our latest v2.6.3 may fix this! https://t.co/RvUnYTicJJ
Slack,0,0,@Gyunlim Default channels for User Groups already exists! 🎉 More info on our Help Center: https://t.co/hcACFGYqyZ
Slack,1,0,@nickansel Gotcha! On desktop, does Preferences > Messages & Media > 'Show images and files...' > 'Even if they're larger than 2MB' help?
Slack,1,0,@JamesSLock Hmm, would you mind writing in so we can take a look? Sounds rather odd and we'd love to help! Here ➡️ https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,0,0,@beckerben Ah, fair point. We'll feedback this to the team. Thanks for letting us know and apologies for the oversight! 🙏
Slack,0,0,@liubinskas Ugh, sorry you had to go to those lengths. Glad to hear you're back up and running though.
Slack,0,0,@jimmyzelinskie Ah, yikes! So sorry. Turns out you've run into a known bug we're currently working to fix. Please hang tight! 🏄
Slack,0,0,@JamesSLock Oh no! 🙈 Sorry for the grossness. What version of the iOS app are you currently using?
Slack,0,0,@ChrisCharabaruk For now, it is available in the direct download version: https://t.co/Rvzftwbhdb
Slack,0,0,@ChrisCharabaruk It's not something we've gotten around to implementing in the Windows Store app just yet. 📝 We'll pass the request across.
Slack,0,0,@aimee_ebooks Hmm, are you up-to-date or is it that new unread messages are not loading? 🕵️
Slack,0,0,@nickansel Ahh, you'd like to see the size of the GIF before you post it? Was it from an integration, an uploaded image, or URL?
Slack,0,0,@chrislorensson Head to https://t.co/dgHMiuFSdY to pick up a pair and support a great cause. 👌✨
Slack,0,0,@celsodantas We're really sorry for the hassle. 😔 We'll keep working on it! If you have any further trouble, please let us know.
Slack,1,0,@alpennec Thanks, Axel!
Slack,1,0,@agisilaosts Ugh, we're so sorry. Is this on desktop or mobile? Mac, Windows, Linux? Android or iOS?
Slack,1,0,@dougblackio We can sure consider it, thanks for the feedback! 🙇
Slack,1,0,@DavidMuroII That's quite the interesting thought. 💡 We'll definitely take the suggestion on board, thanks for reaching out! 🙇
Slack,1,0,@alpennec Too easy! We'll keep you posted. 💌
Slack,0,0,@celsodantas Sorry, friend. Please try swiping right-to-left to open the menu, then Settings > Advanced > Reset Cache. Does that help? 🤞
Slack,1,0,@picsoung Nifty! 🤖🎈
Slack,0,0,@DaleskaPr We're so sorry! Can you please try refreshing with ctrl/cmd + R if you're still experiencing troubles?
Slack,0,0,@djshiow Oh, the horror! 😱 Maybe a custom emoji in your status will fill the gaping void. https://t.co/Tly0GdV0H8
Slack,0,0,@jake_quade Nice! ⬛️⚪️🍃
Slack,1,0,@jake_quade Oh you flatterer, you! Do you have a fantastic custom theme? Share with the class! 🎨💻
Slack,0,0,@alex112269 Oh brilliant, we hope it helps! If not, just give us another shout and we'll lend a hand. 🔊
Slack,1,0,@sujdark Ooooh, great suggestion. We'll make a note of this for future development! In writing, for now. 😅
Slack,0,0,@CocoKur Hmm, we’re not quite sure what you’re looking for, but if you drop a note to feedback@slack.com we can see what we can share! 🙏
Slack,1,0,@jake_quade 🐱💭🌃💙
We'll let the team know that this is something you'd like to see. Thanks, Jake!
Slack,0,0,@MykeBates We'll consider it! However, this is something that's not likely to change any time soon, unfortunately. Sorry about that, Myke.
Slack,1,0,@alpennec Want us to tweet you when we have a fix? 🙏
Slack,0,0,@alpennec We apologize for the troubles here! We're looking into fixing this so that it requires fewer taps to answer on iOS.
Slack,1,0,@eggsbuttersugar Great feedback! We see how this would be helpful, and we'll pass your tweet along to our Mac desktop folks. 😉
Slack,1,0,@SuperTonic64 Not at the moment, sorry! Suggested statuses can only be set at the team level. 💁🏼
Slack,3,1,@RuePee @KristyT Ah, we're afraid that we won't be streaming or recording this event, but we're hoping to write a blog post post-event. ☺️
Slack,1,0,@ryanvarick Or were you looking to set unique DM notification preferences on a one-by-one basis, like you can do for channels?
Slack,0,0,@ryanvarick Hmm! You can set your notifications for DMs and keywords only. Does that work? It's under Preferences > Notifications.
Slack,1,0,@bobschwenkler @joy014 Pssst. We made this happen for you. Refresh your app with Cmd/Ctrl + R to play m4a files in Slack now. 😉
Slack,1,0,@iamtherealcmk Thanks for the suggestion! We see how one unified account would be supremely handy for you.
Slack,0,0,@teppo It's a bug! And it affects all audio files on iOS, not just WAV files. Sorry, we'll fix this – want us to tweet you when it's done?
Slack,0,0,@alex112269 Oh no, we're so sorry! Are you still having troubles? If so, which version of the app are you seeing this on? 🙏
Slack,0,0,@bobschwenkler @joy014 Ah, no, .m4a files aren't supported yet! Sorry, Bob. We'd like to offer this ability for .m4a files in the future.
Slack,0,0,@6byNine Ah, we see what you mean! Sorry for any confusion - we've passed this along to our team for a closer look! 👀
Slack,0,0,@MykeBates Not at the moment, we're afraid. We've only allowed certain widely-adopted services to display inline HTML and play media. 🙁
Slack,0,0,@mtjmelody Ack, are you referring to the "Find my Team" email? 😞
Slack,1,0,@NicholasNConrad Thanks for the suggestion! We see what you mean and we'll give it more thought. 🙇🏻
Slack,0,0,@f1xedgear Sorry about that! There's no way to turn it off, as Slackbot is designed to be a helper bot who responds to your messages. 😣
Slack,0,0,@BlnaryMlke That's fair. We'll keep noodling on how we can keep folks from different teams connected while preserving the team structure.
Slack,0,0,@kpfefferle We're afraid that's a desktop-only preference for now. Sorry about that, Kevin. Perhaps in the future. 😓
Slack,0,0,@sarbbottam You can check your team's Admins and Owners from https://t.co/Pixhy359hq > click on "view admins".
Slack,0,0,@sarbbottam For now, could you perhaps invite a team Admin (not necessarily an Owner) into the channel so they can archive it?
Slack,0,0,@sarbbottam Oof. We agree, that's bad. We're planning on fixing this.
Slack,0,0,@nileshtrivedi Oh! A team Admin or Owner will need to get in touch with us at feedback@slack.com to request a shared invite link first. 😉
Slack,0,0,@daphne_mir Oh, y'know. Mostly because of reasons. And stuff. 😇
Slack,1,0,@EM_marketing Could you kindly drop us a note at feedback@slack.com? Our Specialists would like to take a closer look at this! 💫🚀
Slack,0,0,@jugrand Time for a midnight snack! 🍧
Slack,0,0,@NotZombies 😕 Would you mind writing in to feedback@slack.com? We'd like to investigate this.
Slack,0,0,@lwaldal We see why it could be handy to automatically adjust this. Thanks for sharing this suggestion! 👍
Slack,0,0,@lwaldal The app should adjust the timing of your messages but adjusting your profile timezone is a manual step. 🙁
Slack,0,0,@terceravencida ¡Lo sentimos! ☹️ Mira al FAQ de PlusPlus: https://t.co/pGJvx2KB1D o los puedes contactar a ellos a support@plusplus.chat.
Slack,1,0,@alyssamazzina ...been no activity for the last week. We hope this helps! 🎀 2/2
Slack,1,0,@alyssamazzina Aha! A DM will be removed from your sidebar if there's no unread messages, it hasn't been opened lately, and there's... 1/2
Slack,1,0,@jayman Yuck. 🚫⚪️ Would you mind dropping us a message at feedback@slack.com so we can take a look under the hood?
Slack,0,0,@jshiplett We don’t have that data available, but we do listen to all user feedback. We’ll be happy to share your thoughts with the team. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@itsQuietEarp Sorry for the hassle! Check out this article from our Help Center for step-by-step instructions: https://t.co/FqmSyx2g39
Slack,2,0,@riklomas Ah, we see what you mean. We'll pass this onto the team for a look! 🔍👀
Slack,0,0,@aSloppyJo3 Jeepers, that sounds buggy. We'd like to investigate this – could you kindly drop us a line at feedback@slack.com? 💌🐛
Slack,0,0,@vasantkumar Noted! No plans to share at the moment, but we'll pass your thoughts to the team. Thanks for sending your feedback our way! 📚
Slack,0,0,@ParkerNielsen Oh, that would be wonderful! No plans to share at the moment but we'll let the team know you'd like to see this happen. 📸
Slack,0,0,@domurtag Sorry about that! If you head into your System Prefs > General and toggle your default browser, does that fix the issue?
Slack,0,0,@TheJoWo So if you have more than 10 active DMs going, Slack should keep them all open. Is that not happening for you?
Slack,0,0,@TheJoWo Looks like we had it wrong. Slack will display all recent active conversations and close DMs with no activity over time.
Slack,0,0,@daveixd @TrueHarlequin @DesignerHangout Turning that feature off is a team setting! Talk to an owner or admin: https://t.co/L15Q1EAh7K
Slack,0,0,@iservin 👍
Slack,0,0,@matthaggerty Oh dear! Could you please try resetting your cache, or dropping us a line? feedback@slack.com
Slack,0,0,@outlandishjosh  😱 Yikes! Are you able to connect to Slack via a browser?
Slack,0,0,@BlnaryMlke We're listening! While Slack is intended for closed work groups, we'll be happy to pass your feedback on.
Slack,0,0,@6byNine Each grey line under the date indicates a separate incident. Is that what you're referring to?
Slack,0,0,@sarbbottam Good grief, sorry for the frustration. Your Team Owner can change that setting at https://t.co/zFsyMlLi7M. 🌸
Slack,1,0,@ThatHarmanSingh Oh, that really would be easier to view for a long list of keywords. We'll pass that feedback along. Sorry! 🙏
Slack,0,0,@notthatnathan Yikes, sorry for the trouble! What version of the app are you running?
Slack,0,0,@KWarren Rats. Would you mind dropping us a note at feedback@slack.com some more investigation? 🤔📬
Slack,0,0,@ChrisCharabaruk Unfortunately this is not possible right now – but we hear you! That would be handy.
Slack,6,0,@LauraHayesDC :blush: We'll pass that along to her manager. 

(Or rather, to use first person for once, I'll pass t… https://t.co/1Np1eUeWNR
Slack,0,0,@openjck We definitely hear you. It's something we've discussed and certainly would make life easier if you're on multiple teams.
Slack,1,0,@LessIsMoi If you go into that channel and type `/remind list`, you'll see the channel-specific reminders listed along with delete links.
Slack,1,0,@fahrenq Yikes, sorry for the frustration – but thank you for sending this our way! Feedback noted. 📝🙇
Slack,0,0,@jimmyzelinskie 😬 Really sorry. Is this on mobile? If so, which device?
Slack,0,0,@alyssamazzina DMs stay open even if the other side closes them. Do you have the setting on to only view channels/DMs with unread messages?
Slack,0,0,@iservin Definitely not fun. 😞 To help troubleshoot, can you log into Slack through Chrome and see if the same thing happens there?
Slack,0,0,@domurtag Huh. And links from Slack are opening in a brand new window instead of just a new tab of an existing window?
Slack,0,0,@CocoKur A survey conducted within Slack? You might want to look through the App Directory. For example: https://t.co/zSOpHt4AtP
Slack,0,0,@jasonmulligan Mmm, copy/pasta sounds delicious! 🍝 😋 Are snippets a possibility for you here? https://t.co/BvrXwLu2JR
Slack,0,0,@nerdgirl We designed it to match All Unreads, though it can be a bit confusing since it is different than all channels. 😬 Sorry! 🙏
Slack,0,0,@jayman 🤔 Try pressing `Shift + Esc` in that team to mark everything as read. If that doesn't work, clear the cache: `Help > Clear Cache`
Slack,1,0,@jordan_ryan Ah we see. We're making incremental changes to memory use as often as we can. Thanks for your patience!
Slack,0,0,@emad_younis 👋 Muting and blocking of individual Slack team members is not something we have plans for. We'll note the request though!
Slack,1,0,@JSn1nj4 It's something the team is considering carefully!
Slack,1,0,@venatiodecorus We appreciate the feedback and we'll pass it on!
Slack,5,1,@LauraHayesDC This is a good public service you are performing. But that ain't no robot. Just someone here at Slack.
Slack,0,0,@EM_marketing You can choose your account on setup. However, you can only have one Asana account associated with Slack at a time.
Slack,0,0,@jordan_ryan Ah, have you tried "snoozing" them? https://t.co/ELuFDoqR2q
Slack,0,0,@nerdgirl Ah, that's because threads always open at the top. This is an interesting point, though: we'll pass it along to the team here! 📝
Slack,1,0,@HoldenthePage Thanks for flagging this. Our security team is aware and working on the issue.
Slack,0,0,@higgis Hrmm, that's no good. To clarify, is this happening in one of our desktop apps, in a browser, or on your mobile device? 🤔
Slack,1,0,@sonyybalonyy 👍
Slack,0,0,@lwaldal Oh, no! Have you even gone into your profile and adjusted your time zone there? 😞
Slack,0,0,@steve_lacy Thanks for letting us know! If it happens again please check what version you are running and update if possible. 🙌
Slack,0,0,@nate23 So sorry about this! Could you please write in so we can get some information? feedback@slack.com 🙌
Slack,0,0,@gonedark Restarting the app should cut that DM list down to 10 names + Slackbot, and hopefully you can trim things down from there! ✂️
Slack,1,0,@risiofficial Oh we are. We like everyone! 🌼
Slack,0,0,@TheArchivum Oh, you can't make a private channel public, alas. You'd have to spin up a whole new channel in that case!
Slack,0,0,@TheJoWo ...around! ⭐️ 2/2
Slack,0,0,@TheJoWo You'll always get reset back to 10 after restarting, sadly. You can star the important DMs, though, so
 they always stick... 1/2
Slack,0,0,@garethkbc Absolutely! If it doesn't fit in140 characters, drop us a note at feedback@slack.com? 💖
Slack,1,0,@RyanGWilson Ah, yes, unfortunately. This bug is on our radar, though, and we're hoping to get it all fixed up very soon! 📂😓
Slack,0,0,@sgulbetekin Oh, no! We were having some trouble with this earlier, but everything should be A-OK now. Are you still running into this? 😞
Slack,0,0,@DanielGonzo2016 You could use User Groups for this! For more info on those… https://t.co/ZKQJK378Fr
Slack,1,0,@xtinaashbaugh Oh! That's a lot of pressure. We're just glad to be helping! 😅
Slack,1,0,@jphenow Oh, yikes! Looks like the app is suddenly missing its style data. Is that persisting after refreshing or clearing out its cache? 😬
Slack,0,0,@kpeckett Thanks for letting us know! Things should indeed be working normally again now. 🙌
Slack,0,0,@kpeckett Yikes, sorry for the trouble! Could you please try to reload by hitting Ctrl+R?
Slack,0,0,@jasonmulligan Uh-oh 🙈 that certainly should stop the search! Sorry for the troubles. We'll happily pass this onto the team 🗒
Slack,1,0,@geekyyang Glad to hear you like the star feature! 🌟
Slack,1,0,@CEason06 Here's our Slack Youtube channel: https://t.co/FaIvoh73Bz 🙌
Slack,1,0,@jamyn Right, hopefully that should be resolved soon! 🙏
Slack,0,0,@ThatJoeCoutcher 😍
Slack,0,0,@themichaelpitt We're looking into this right now, sorry for the trouble! Our status site is available here: https://t.co/hlhV4Z15g6
Slack,0,0,@ilovedfs Egad! Thanks for letting us know about Calls. We're actively working on fixing the slowness issues. Really sorry!
Slack,0,0,@ahnberg We're looking into this as we speak. Sorry again Mattias! Our status site is available here: https://t.co/Wmg1T0dCQq
Slack,0,0,@steve_lacy Uh-oh 🙈 does a refresh (cmd/ctrl + R) help?
Slack,0,0,@sotobean17 Ahhh, so sorry! Please bear with us while we get things back to working order again 🌟
Slack,0,0,@j_metzmeier We're very sorry for the trouble. We're working to get things back to normal as quickly as we can.
Slack,1,0,@jardelrodrim Would you mind writing in so we can discuss this in more detail? 🙏 https://t.co/a3LfcTHHMr
Slack,0,0,@doomspork We're working on fixing connection issues some folks are seeing and *just* updated the status site. Really sorry! 🙏
Slack,0,0,@SynteZZZ We're on it! Thanks for hanging tight and apologies in the meantime.
Slack,0,0,@mrcgranados We're very sorry about the trouble. Our team is working to fix things up as quickly as we can.
Slack,0,0,@Akaryatrh Really sorry! We're working on getting things running smoothly again. For now, give it a refresh and see if that helps. (Cmd + R)
Slack,1,0,@irpolarbear So sorry for the trouble We're working to get things back to normal as quickly as we can.
Slack,0,0,@achellios Sorry, we're working on resolving the issue right now. Let us know if a reload resolves the issue and thanks for bearing with us.
Slack,0,0,@Ky1eTH
