Slack,0,0,@narrowtux We've got a few bugs on the blue bar not disappearing, so it may require a click or hitting Esc while we work on fixing this.
Slack,0,0,@janaabsound Yikes, we're so sorry! 😞 Can you please write us at feedback@slack.com so that we can take a deeper look? 🙇
Slack,2,0,@MBoffin Thanks for confirming. We've noted it as a bug and our engineers will get to it ASAP! Sorry for the hassle in the meantime. 🐛🔨
Slack,1,0,@UliArmbruster Ah, you'd like to send voice notes? That's a great idea and we'll consider it for the future. Thanks, Uli!
Slack,0,0,@TwistedEdge Sorry about that! Our team is looking into this issue now. We'll squish that bug, and we'll squish it good. 👢🐛
Slack,2,0,@XGenStudios To tweet or not to tweet, that is the question! (We usually just tweet 🤔)
Slack,0,0,@JordanHawker Eeek, that sounds like a bug. Are you experiencing this issue on iOS, by chance? Or rather, on the desktop app or browser?
Slack,1,0,@Bl1zz Thanks for the suggestion! We'll certainly consider it.
Slack,1,0,@leahtak_ Perhaps the Asana app integration could be what you're looking for!  https://t.co/QLOfNXoxGI
Slack,0,0,@damonclarksaid Yessir! We have an Email to Slack integration! Read all about it: https://t.co/nt17K6P3yO 🗞
Slack,0,0,@jayseeg No worries. You're on a Mac, right? Each team requires 250 MB of RAM. Would you say your CPU usage is in excess of 50%, though? 🤔
Slack,2,0,@wesburke @nphaskins Huzzah! You can do it! Here, have some sustenance. 🌮 🌮
Slack,0,0,@jayseeg Also... do you want to debug in private? We're flexible! If so, just head to the desktop app menu > Report Issue.
Slack,0,0,@jayseeg Sorry for the troubles. 😑 We're working to make the desktop app more lightweight. How many teams are you signed into?
Slack,1,0,@JayantPahuja @gggodhwani It's a new keyboard accessibility feature! It shows that the box is the active element on the page. 😄
Slack,1,0,@pigeonfolk Oooh, sorry about that. We'll pass the request for weekly stats on to our team.
Slack,0,0,@giveadsir Is there anything we can help you with? You can also send us a note at any time at feedback@slack.com! 📬
Slack,0,0,@RenoInMO Yes, any messages sent by you are counted as your messages.
Slack,0,0,@capitocapito Ooooh. This might be a bug. 🐞 Would it be possible for you to get in touch via feedback@slack.com? We can help further!
Slack,0,0,@smackfu Good to know.
Slack,0,0,@jleach87 Hmm, sorry about that! Actually, would it be possible for you to get in touch with us by email? Feedback@slack.com, please! 🙏
Slack,0,0,@hfx_ben Gotcha. Has this always been a problem in Firefox? Perhaps there's a Firefox add-on interfering here. Which add-ons do you use? 🤔
Slack,0,0,@narrowtux Great! Let us know if this issue resurfaces even after you've pressed "Mark as Read"! 📚
Slack,2,0,@oHMOSh Well thank goodness for that.
Slack,0,0,@mtoledo That's a great idea! We'll keep it in mind. 🤔
Slack,0,0,@Rob_Reuter We're so pleased you like it! 💤🛏
Slack,7,2,@johncmckim The force is strong with that bot. 🌠
Slack,0,0,@Adron That's correct - it would be necessary to to pin the group of messages individually. 📍😀
Slack,0,0,@gstathis If the announcement includes one of Slackbot's trigger words or phrases, Slackbot will respond! More here: https://t.co/8pIIM8E0qI
Slack,0,0,@elmajian Certainly, we see how that would be sensible! We appreciate the suggestion! 🐞
Slack,0,0,@iamjro We assure you - Slack socks are awesome. You can get in on the awesome here: https://t.co/vhPGzZ7F7D 🐰
Slack,1,0,@c_vader Oh no! 😢  Can you drop us a line at feedback@slack.com and let us know which Android you're using? 📝
Slack,0,0,@Adron How about pinning (https://t.co/GSZeLB8Zi3) and starring (https://t.co/daEG9mHjsS)? Two nifty ways to keep track of messages! 📍⭐️
Slack,0,0,@avaohh If you go to https://t.co/oDFgTXTjsZ, do you see it there in Pending Invitations?
Slack,0,0,@shutupbrendance We're exploring a few issues with Android notifications. Mind writing to feedback@slack.com so we can troubleshoot further?
Slack,0,0,@kripto That would be helpful, but most likely you'll need to reauthorize an account or make some edits to the integration. Sorry!
Slack,0,0,@taylormorris It's something we're working on! For now there's custom emojis, like the many `:thinking:` we've made: https://t.co/Tly0GdV0H8
Slack,0,0,@capitocapito So sorry. That is something you're able to see on a paid team, but the view is more limited for free plans. 🙏
Slack,1,0,@blokefrompoland Really sorry. These stats should be available for all paid teams, and we offer a more limited view on free teams.
Slack,0,0,@poige Eek! We're definitely exploring how to make this better. Sorry about this. 🙏
Slack,0,0,@bramschulting Folks do see your status in various places, but only gets you part way there. Definitely a useful request we'll pass along!
Slack,0,0,@elijahmanor /bitmoji dab
Slack,1,0,@c_vader 😬  Can you try clearing your local cache (Settings > Advanced > Reset local storage) and see if that gets notifications working?
Slack,0,0,@elmajian We're sorry to say it's not right now, but we can certainly let the team know you're interested. 😅
Slack,0,0,@michaelperry Got it. Good food for thought for us! Thanks so much for sharing. 👯
Slack,0,0,@narrowtux Is there a blue bar at the top letting you know there are unread messages? If so, does clicking "Mark as Read" help clear it up?
Slack,0,0,@hfx_ben Our bad. What we mean is: are you using Slack in the browser when this happens, or in an app?
Slack,0,0,@tmburke 🙌💕
Slack,1,0,@michaelperry Interesting. So kind of like a clock in/clock out solution?
Slack,0,0,@hfx_ben Huh, that does sound like oddness. How are you using Slack when this happens? (e.g. mac or windows desktop app, browser, mobile)
Slack,0,0,@shutupbrendance Hmm. Let's see if we can troubleshoot. Mind clearing the app's cache to start? (Settings > Advanced > Reset local storage)
Slack,0,0,@gggodhwani @JayantPahuja Would love to pass this along. Is it that the message box is getting focus when it shouldn't? Which browser?
Slack,0,0,@MBoffin Really sorry. ((´д｀)) Is this in the Windows desktop app or web browser?
Slack,0,0,@TwistedEdge 🤔 Is this happening on the desktop app? If so, can you try clearing your cache? (Help > Clear Cache and Restart)
Slack,1,0,@mashkndk Interesting! We'll give it some thought. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@garrettmurray Understood. Thanks for the additional detail, and for being patient with us. 😓
Slack,0,0,@zombywuf Understood. We've shared that detail with the team. We're sorry we don't have a workaround in the meantime. 😓
Slack,0,0,@garrettmurray We're so sorry! We erred on the side of less clutter, but we see what you mean. We'll pass this over to the team. 🙇
Slack,3,0,@JT_Grimes Interesting! Leave it with us and we'll share it with the team.
Slack,0,0,@VincentGarguilo Your admin should be able to adjust your team's default status suggestions for you, in that case! https://t.co/8k5GsiisEO 📝
Slack,2,0,@KateGardiner You're more than welcome! 😍
Slack,0,0,@bramschulting Would a combination of setting DND and setting a custom status help? That way, if someone messages you, they see both. 🙏
Slack,0,0,@JustinWise You shouldn't, no, though the browser version of the app may run a bit smoother for you. Let us know if you have any issues! 💻
Slack,1,0,@ezagroba Expected behavior right now, although we'll pass the feedback that it's a bit unusual onto the team. Thanks for sharing!
Slack,0,0,@arranrp You're most welcome. 💕
Slack,0,0,@LuceFowler That's no good at all! Would you be able to drop us a line at feedback@slack.com so we can dig a little deeper into this? 😓💌
Slack,1,0,@van_miranda Yes, this is a bit of a quirk of sharing files right now. We've noted it and will share your feedback with the team. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@narrowtux Well, that's strange. Is that happening in one of our desktop apps, or while you're on mobile, or both? Always the same team? 🤔
Slack,1,0,@RenoInMO About once a day. There should be a little note at the top of your team's stats page that says the last time the data was updated!
Slack,0,0,@arranrp You can turn off animated emoji and gifs in Preferences > Accessibility. Does that help?
Slack,7,0,@nathansmith Nathan.
Slack,1,0,@c_vader Oh no! 😓 What about them isn't working, exactly?
Slack,1,0,@drbrain Ah, there's no way to hide that right now, but that's a pretty reasonable suggestion! We'll definitely give this some thought. 🤔
Slack,1,0,@AliLincolnTVP Sort of! One of your admins could change your team's default suggested statuses from right here… https://t.co/8k5GsiisEO 💬
Slack,94,33,If marketing is herding cats, let Slack be your cat corral. These apps help get the job done. https://t.co/1HZ8gVw9qU
Slack,1,0,@eliorivero Yikes! Would you mind dropping us a line at feedback@slack.com so we can further assist with this? That sounds frustrating. 😓
Slack,0,0,@mattrothenberg We would love this too! Our engineers are looking into what's possible here. 🐳
Slack,0,0,@AdamWhitcroft Oh, that's a really neat idea! We'll let the team know about that. 💡📝
Slack,0,0,@zombywuf Do you have custom key mapping for Ctrl? We've been tracking a bug with that, sorry. 😕
Slack,1,0,@colene They just keep hatching... 🐣
Slack,1,0,@eccomi_leah 🐴🦄🐎🏇🐫
Slack,2,0,@Lazerchickenzzz That seems pretty reasonable! We'll pass that along to the rest of the team here.
Slack,0,0,@eliorivero Well, that's odd! Does that persist if you head into that team and use the SHIFT+ESC shortcut to mark everything as read? 🤔
Slack,0,0,@keepsite Oh, no! This is a known issue, alas, but our team is looking into it and hopes to have it fixed up very soon. 😓
Slack,0,0,@Codepope You can set yourself a very extended daily Do Not Disturb period, but can't do that for a whole week. Something we'll look into! 🏖
Slack,0,0,@Kirst85 Oh, we're really just giving read receipts the serious consideration they deserve. They would really change how people use the app!
Slack,0,0,@TannerWayne Hrmm. Would you be able to drop us a line at feedback@slack.com? It'd be helpful if we could take a look at your recent logs! 💌
Slack,0,0,@neonhomer Oh, you could certainly try to steer any DMs you receive toward a proper channel. That might encourage your team to do the same!
Slack,0,0,@pigeonfolk Oh no! What happened? 🙁
Slack,1,0,@Lazerchickenzzz It was a tricky choice! We'll keep thinking about how to do this more thoughtfully. Thanks for letting us know. 🍎
Slack,0,0,@LIZZY_B_ Welcome! We're glad you're here. 💐
Slack,0,0,@fffinkel It's true! And some people want to see everything as it happens. If that's not your style, keep them off, with our blessing. 🎈
Slack,0,0,@resource11 💃👯⌨️
Slack,1,0,@BellJoannaL ☺️💙
Slack,0,0,@zombywuf Not in the least! Could you explain more about what's happening when selecting text, and which app? We'd like to investigate.
Slack,0,0,@stantonk We're very glad to hear it!
Slack,0,0,@TannerWayne Oh gosh, so sorry! Which operating system are you using?
Slack,0,0,@ChrisPavese Noted — thank you! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@sam_hermans can you write into feedback@slack.com, we'll take a look for you!
Slack,0,0,@nezlok Will pass along this request for you Kevin, sorry that we don't offer this right now!
Slack,0,0,@rudyrichter Not right now, sorry about that. Will let the team know you'd like that option for future consideration.
Slack,0,0,@eromerohall It's not possible to remove Slackbot! Is something wrong?
Slack,1,0,@vaicine Will pass this request along for you James! 🙌
Slack,0,0,@SashaFrisbee There isn't an option to do this unfortunately. We recommend checking with your Admins for the best course of action to take!
Slack,0,0,@mja821228 You're very welcome!
Slack,0,0,@kbadawii It's not possible to make posts yet on mobile, sorry about that!
Slack,0,0,@SashaFrisbee 😞Can you report this to the Admins on your team? You can find them under the three dot menu in top right > Team Directory
Slack,0,0,@Abenexer Sorry about that! It was causing a lot of mistaken snippets being created.
Slack,0,0,@mongoaron Thanks so much!
Slack,1,0,@UnmaskedEd @BrantonTech We'd be happy to provide some guidance to get started! Please reach out to feedback@slack.com and we can help :)
Slack,0,0,@40_thieves Thanks so much :)
Slack,1,0,@haenschenhans Thanks for the feedback on this! We're working on improvements so we will share this idea with the team 🙏
Slack,0,0,@mongoaron Keywords should produce a badge 🤔 Would you mind contacting /feedback so we can look into this more closely for you? 🙏
Slack,0,0,@ConnorVG  Hmm 🤔 Sorry for the frustration. Let us share this with the team and we will look into that. Thanks for raising this 🙏
Slack,0,0,@40_thieves You're most likely hitting a bug that we're currently working on. If you could please contact /feedback we can dig further 🙏
Slack,0,0,@blokefrompoland Hmm, we can certainly mention this to the team to see if we could include that!
Slack,0,0,@40_thieves Could you please try Shift + Esc to see if that removes it for you? Failing that you can try help > clear cache and restart 🙏
Slack,0,0,@SamNello31 We've received some feedback around this and will be giving it further consideration down the line! :)
Slack,0,0,@ConnorVG It should be dark only when you are actually clicked into the box. If you click elsewhere on the screen it should return to light.
Slack,1,0,@mikestreety Sorry about that, we will let the team know that you'd like to see this down the line :)
Slack,0,0,@Dyuti_94 No problem at all!
Slack,0,0,@LuceFowler We've not had any reports of this so far  Does the issue persist after a reload and is everyone on the team seeing this?
Slack,0,0,@Dyuti_94 Ah, apologies! An owner will be able to put that setting in place via the link from our last Tweet. Admins won't see the option.
Slack,0,0,@tac3395 (Sorry for not suggesting that.)
Slack,0,0,@tac3395 If you can get in touch with one, they will be able to deactivate it, yes.
Slack,0,0,@gary_bury Oh no! Files or text?
Slack,0,0,@tac3395 Not without the password or access to the email account — sorry about that!
Slack,0,0,@AbdalAalaa It can depend a little on how busy things are, but we'll get back to you just as soon as we can — thanks! 🙌
Slack,0,0,@abhijeetmk Thank you! Sorry for the frustration 😱
Slack,0,0,@abhijeetmk If they're recent DMs going missing, something may be up, sorry. Care to drop us a line? https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,0,0,@AbdalAalaa Ah! In that case, could you drop us a line, sorry: https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,0,0,@ChrisCamicas Lovely stuff. Thank you.
Slack,0,0,@ysihaoy Please do drop us a line if this doesn't help: https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,0,0,@sindarina Ah.Could you send a screenshot of the message to feedback@slack.com? We'll take a look 🙌
Slack,1,0,@AbdalAalaa You may need to ask a Team Admin or Owner to help in that case.
Slack,0,0,@abhijeetmk You can jump to any DM quickly with Cmd/Ctrl Shift K — does that help?
Slack,2,0,@themaxsandelin  https://t.co/cViX3YL3ea
Slack,0,0,@sindarina Sorry about that! What's the message you're putting in?
Slack,1,0,@CatherineCe Eep! If you write in we'll help in any way we can: https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,0,0,@Dyuti_94 Absolutement: https://t.co/4Ke5KLpUMn
Slack,0,0,@ChrisCamicas Sorry about that! Do you mind dropping us some details: https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,1,0,@themaxsandelin You could set "y" — though not "(y)" — as an alias here: https://t.co/VwJXlFHUgU 👍
Slack,0,0,@abhijeetmk But you can star DMs to keep them in view: https://t.co/sKtDhc6RWW
Slack,0,0,@abhijeetmk Sorry for any confusion — on desktop, this list shows only certain recent conversations…
Slack,0,0,@kasirSS It's our prime directive 😍
Slack,0,0,@alesevilla92 We can! Do you mind dropping us a line, though? https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,0,0,@bMurfy @Munchious @Glinner  Okay, one last time… 🐄🐄🐄
Slack,0,0,@kaihendry Hmm! The results here aren't Slack-endorsed, but in case they're of use: https://t.co/JBClmnNkfx
Slack,0,0,@___leigh___ We hear you — thanks for the feedback 🙌
Slack,0,0,@maebiforae Aha! Gotcha. This is something we're working on and will hopefully have fixed in a future update. Please bear with us! 🐻💓
Slack,1,0,@gmem_ @GitGalaxy Phew! Glad to hear it. Hope it's smooth sailing from here! 🌊⛵️
Slack,0,0,@gmem_ @GitGalaxy  Oh no, sorry for the hassle. Would you mind dropping us a note at feedback@slack.com so we can take a closer look? 🙏
Slack,0,0,@CatherineCe Yikes! Sorry Slackbot has gone rogue. 😔 Do you see the DMs duplicated like that on desktop as well?
Slack,0,0,@___leigh___ 💡🔥 Perhaps try uploading your own custom emoji? Here ➡️ https://t.co/PLY41JVO7n
Slack,0,0,@ThePropellGroup Hmm, apologies for the trouble! Would you mind dropping us a note at feedback@slack.com so we can take a look?
Slack,7,0,@heyambrosia Best. Girlfriend. Ever. 🎈
Slack,0,0,@ysihaoy Sorry for this – it's definitely an issue we're looking into. Does sending a message in #general from the Android app help at all?
Slack,0,0,@tesla60d They'll definitely be gone forever, we're afraid. Sorry for the bad news. 😞
Slack,0,0,@ChrisPavese Yep! What type of keyboard shortcuts would you love to see? ⌨️
Slack,1,0,@mgouline This isn't an available feature just yet, but we certainly see the benefits. We'll pass along the suggestion! 🙌
Slack,0,0,@maebiforae Hmm. 🤔 Perhaps you could subscribe to the calendars via GCal, then use the Calendar integration. Might that do the trick? 🙏
Slack,1,0,@Frikster42 Oooh, that could indeed be nice! It might make a few workflows a little smoother. Thanks so much for sharing! 🙇
Slack,1,0,@ToriMarkets Nawww, you're making us blush! 😊 Thanks to YOU for being so awesome. 🤗
Slack,1,0,@aaronorosen Oooh, that'd indeed be quite nice. Feedback duly noted! 📝 Also, we ❤️ you too!
Slack,0,0,@WhatsDonIsDon You could upload the files privately, and then create external links? 🤔 Though these links could be used outside your team.
Slack,1,0,@jmfurlott If you hop to Preferences > Messages & Media and de-select "Show images from linked websites" it might do the trick! 🙏
Slack,0,0,@houkagoweedtime Owners can change the Team icon in a web browser here: https://t.co/AVAi3UnNT9. Does that help? 🙇
Slack,1,0,@aaronorosen This is only our first version of threads. We can't make any promises but attachments are something we're looking into. 🔮
Slack,0,0,@mrfrielcodes We'll be here, working hard to make Slack worth every penny. Hold tight! 😥🙏🤗💖
Slack,0,0,@WhatsDonIsDon If you share the design in a public channel in your team, then copy the link, it will preview in your post. Does that help? 🙇
Slack,0,0,@brettaaroncooke 😍🎷🏂💖
Slack,2,0,@johndagostino We can see where this might be helpful, though there are some privacy issues we'd need to consider. Thanks for sharing! 🙇😊
Slack,0,0,@fogarty22 Take a look and let us know if you have any questions!
Slack,0,1,@maknz  😭 We're sorry for the extra steps. We'll do our best to fix this speedily! 🛠
Slack,0,0,@AaronM_NZ  😢  This is a known bug. So sorry about this. We'll do our best to resolve it shortly! 🐛 🛠
Slack,0,0,@fogarty22 We have good news 📰 https://t.co/xI4p8fBovY.
Slack,0,0,@fogarty22 Aw, it truly makes our day to hear this! 🌼
Slack,0,0,@h0h0h0 Let us know if you have any specific questions! We'd be happy to help! 😀
Slack,0,0,@h0h0h0 Here are 2 resources! ✨ Our intro video: https://t.co/Ub9HE9Qkul Also, a brief rundown of what is Slack: https://t.co/88nL2GXZnh
Slack,0,0,@mmay_60 No, that isn't possible. 😕 We do have a handy Help Center article that lists what is possible. Take a peek: https://t.co/QZrfMTb7Mw
Slack,1,0,@DillonShook 😢 You may get better connectivity by resetting your cache. Follow these steps in Slack: Settings > Advanced > Reset Cache.
Slack,0,0,@wheronui @cjsbishop @Bitmoji There's an app! https://t.co/guDaO4HLjx
Slack,2,0,@tarungangwani Hey thanks! We use the c3 charting library, and d3 for most of the custom styling. 👍
Slack,0,0,@JKarp8  👋 At this time, it is not possible to import direct messages to a new team.
Slack,0,0,@thomcom Depending on your team's setting, you might be able to take a peek here!  ✨ https://t.co/Vmb31yxEYk
Slack,1,0,@jkrahn Ah, we see what you mean. We'll pass your feedback along to the team. Thanks again for this!
Slack,0,0,@lisa_scheibner 🤗  Anytime, friend!
Slack,1,0,@hiphippie 🙌 We're delighted that you are enjoying this!
Slack,1,0,@tesla60d Ah we have! Could you try updating? Also, can you try tapping the 3 dots icon > Settings > Advanced > Reset local storage?
Slack,0,0,@tedivm Phew! We're glad that helped! Thanks for keeping us posted, and sorry for the hassle there :D
Slack,0,0,@tedivm Ah! Have you tried "Clear cache and restart" from the Help menu? If that doesn't help please drop us a line at feedback@slack.com 🙏
Slack,0,0,@jamesrsowers Sure! https://t.co/OFNepucoxy
Slack,0,0,@jamesrsowers Hmm! There isn't an exact way to do this. Maybe they could add a specific emoji as a custom status. Would that work? 🎾
Slack,0,0,@andrzejkrzywda Not at this time, sorry about that. If this is something you'd like to see, we'll share the idea with the team. Thanks!
Slack,0,0,@annapickard @Veidit We'll speak for the rest of us: it's been pretty delightful so far! 💖
Slack,0,0,@phil_renaud Yup! We sure did 😉
Slack,0,0,@tedivm Ooh, can you check the version number for us? To do this, please open the Slack menu, and click "About Slack" 🙇
Slack,0,0,@brianisme But seriously, we just needed to cut it off somewhere, and 23 seemed as good a number as any!
Slack,1,0,@brianisme Now, don't overreact. 😉
Slack,0,0,@Analysto Hey thanks! 🎉
Slack,0,0,@jkrahn Thanks for the feedback 🙏
Slack,0,0,@jkrahn That's an interesting way to look at it! We think analytics data is valuable to teams, and a worthwhile investment.
Slack,0,0,@tedivm 👋🏽 We'd like to take a look into this! Are you running the Windows app or the Mac app?
Slack,30,1,We're rolling out now, and hope to have it out to everyone within the day. 🔜
Slack,108,31,Curious how your team uses Slack over time? If so, we think you’ll like our brand new Analytics. #changelog… https://t.co/M9Biwdz1ev
Slack,0,0,@JonnoTheBonno Sorry for the frustration. You can edit your 2FA settings here: https://t.co/vAOLdnixnf
Slack,0,0,@liftedpixel 😿 Were you able to get 2FA setup after that sad walk down memory lane?
Slack,0,0,@yuweet09 You'd want to get in touch with To-Do bot directly https://t.co/KGuYM83Ggg
Slack,0,0,@agmcleod Sorry for the trouble. Please use ctrl/cmd+r to refresh and see if the issue persists.
Slack,0,0,@jeffreydgroot Now that is not expected. Can you quit/restart the app and see if it's still there?
Slack,1,0,@ArtAwake There are plans to address this. Stay tuned! 🙂 📺
Slack,0,0,@jeffreydgroot That bar is expected to be there if you're only signed into one team.
Slack,0,0,@devingd3 Would you please write to feedback@slack.com? Our iOS team wants to look into this.
Slack,0,0,@sebytza05 We'd recommend speaking directly with your team admin so they can deactivate accounts posting inappropriate messages.
Slack,0,0,@stuartpreston That's an interesting idea! 💡 Thanks for the suggestion.
Slack,1,0,@EinfachCharles Thanks for letting us know that's something you'd like to see! 📝
Slack,0,0,@sebytza05 Is Slackbot not working for you? What specifically is the trouble?
Slack,0,0,@olivierb Sorry for the trouble. We're working on improving resource consumption across the board.
Slack,0,0,@IfErrThrowBrick Would you please write to feedback@slack.com with your team details? We'll investigate.
Slack,0,0,@jeekajoo Would you please write to feedback@slack.com? Our Linux team would like to get a bit more information and look into this.
Slack,0,0,@IfErrThrowBrick Yikes! We're sorry for the trouble, Chris. Can you try a quick refresh (Cmd + R or Ctrl + R) to see if that helps?
Slack,1,0,@BWinterrose That is a smart idea! We'll gladly pass it along for further consideration. 👍📝
Slack,0,0,@RandallAGordon Thanks for your feedback, Randall! While there is no way to remove it, it should disappear as your member list grows. 🙌
Slack,0,0,@IanScarffe ...a snapshot of your CPU usage to feedback@slack.com, we'll take a look and see if there's anything we haven't suggested. (2/2)
Slack,0,0,@IanScarffe We're sorry about this, Ian. We've shared every option we currently have to reduce CPU usage. If you can possibly send...(1/2)
Slack,0,0,@JakesPlanet No😓. Though, we're thinking about making it a possibility. Currently, you can set guidelines here: https://t.co/NAz4DCeZfc
Slack,1,0,@mcloide Interesting 🤔. Can you try Cmd + R to see if that helps? You can also try Help > Clear Cache and Restart. Keep us posted!
Slack,0,0,@AbdalAalaa If you don't see 'Remove App,' click 'Edit Configuration' to find the option to 'Remove.'
Slack,0,0,@AbdalAalaa Click 'Remove App' from the configuration page here: https://t.co/ZpLTzsB134
Slack,0,0,@draggingalake Currently, it will say that forever, and there is no way to clear it, yet. That said, we'll pass on your request for this! 💫
Slack,0,0,@knowkalpesh That's the unicode standard name for that emoji: https://t.co/LWDe6yihJt. 🙃
Slack,0,0,@roopakv ... they're still not working after adjusting settings, please let us know at feedback@slack.com. (2/2)
Slack,0,0,@roopakv You can adjust your settings to send mobile notifications for every message! Details here: https://t.co/6BevnqLGUM. If... (1/2)
Slack,1,0,@_peggyli Noted! We'll pass this along to the team. 🙇
Slack,2,0,@theSarawr we've heard it can get you there in less than 12 parsecs!
Slack,1,0,@adammarx13 We'll be here if you need us!
Slack,0,0,@skendrot Pasting won't work! Only a URL/link to a publicly uploaded file. Sorry about that.
Slack,0,0,@skendrot We're working on it! Sorry that it doesn't support file uploads yet. You can paste a link to an image and that'll expand for now.🙌
Slack,2,0,@_peggyli Ahhhh, it is, in that it's the same as the filled circle — but you've changed your sidebar theme so the color has changed.
Slack,0,0,@splitinfinities Neat idea! Will pass this along.
Slack,0,0,@AtSeansHandle It is! It's on our list. Hang in there, it's coming!
Slack,1,0,@alikrausman You should set a reminder for that! 😉 (typing /remind list does the trick!)
Slack,2,0,@Shkeating 15 is the limit, so you totally can!
Slack,2,0,@gallifrexican Woo hoo! 🎉 No plans just yet, but we'll definitely share that suggestion with the right team here.
Slack,0,0,@Memolipd Sorry we don't yet have an update for you on this one - we sure do understand your frustration. Thanks for bearing with us! 🙏
Slack,0,0,@debszenn Would you mind writing in so we can help you with this? https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X. Thanks! 🙏
Slack,0,0,@laborcz We hear you loud and clear! 📱It's certainly on our radar.
Slack,0,0,@fubarhouse 🙌
Slack,0,0,@bjeaurn 💖
Slack,0,0,@Demo318 Everyone knows that puns are the only way to communicate! 😎
Slack,0,0,@laborcz That's not good. Sorry to hear that. Would you mind writing in so we check to see if anything's amiss? https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X 🙏
Slack,1,0,@bjeaurn Oh no! Sorry to hear that. We'll definitely share this feedback with the team. Please pass on our apologies to your coworker 🙇
Slack,0,0,@bjeaurn We think threads function like their own channels, so we sort them that way. We're sorry if that's confusing or disorienting!
Slack,0,0,@coreymcollins A contribution to be proud of 👏
Slack,1,0,@robgough @will_j No plans for a native app, we're afraid. However, we are working hard behind the scenes to improve these battery issues 🛠
Slack,0,0,@paltaie The API method should work. Mind writing in so we can take a closer look? https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X 🙏
Slack,0,0,@Sanzhik It’s on our radar for the future! Negative feedback was related to the fact that the icon wasn’t very useful for many folks.
Slack,2,1,@IntalentUK Thanks for the kind words! 💖
Slack,1,0,@ambonium Hmmm 🤔
Slack,1,1,@IntalentUK 🙌
Slack,2,0,@ambonium Those tears are joyful tears!  Perhaps :rofl: 🤣 is more your bag? 🎒
Slack,0,0,@MithunShanbhag I'm afraid that's not possible, sorry! It's best to only send invites to those people who intend on joining your team 💌
Slack,0,0,@yegct Our sincere apologies for interrupting your day. Would you mind dropping us a line so we can take a closer look at what's happening?
Slack,0,0,@Rhiannon_SJones Oh no, sorry about that. 😞 Our team will be able to help further if you reach out to us using /feedback. 🙇
Slack,1,0,@martinschurig We hear you. The good news is that it's definitely on our radar! Thanks for the feedback. 🙏
Slack,0,0,@will_j Sorry, Will. 😞 Our team is aware and working on it. Hopefully you should see improvements soon. 🙏
Slack,1,0,@Bentexere You should be able to exit it by clicking on X at the top right hand corner. 🙌
Slack,1,0,@dav_hamill We hear you! Sorry about that. We'll share that feedback with the team here. 🙏
Slack,0,0,@mattLefaux This is a great suggestion! 🤔 We'll share it with the team here. Thank you!
Slack,0,0,@DaysUntoldCom Alas, message formatting cannot be turned off. Sorry about that.
Slack,2,0,@annapickard @sjcary Since you've worked so hard for them, here are some bubbles just for you. https://t.co/HDLrUIYhCT
Slack,1,0,@abelovai https://t.co/17kGlZAqDj
Slack,0,0,@NischalShetty Keep us posted! 🙌
Slack,1,0,@MathieuLoutre Yay, good to hear Mathieu! We're still working on the accented characters issue and we're sorry for the hassle with this.
Slack,0,0,@NischalShetty Oh no! What version of the app are you running? Does the issue still appear after a reload of the app (CMD/CTRL + R)? 🤔
Slack,0,0,@esukei Nope. 2.6.3 fixed an issue affecting users on the direct download version of the app, so it's not needed on the App Store.
Slack,0,0,@MathieuLoutre Yikes! That's not good. Would you mind trying to refresh your app (CMD/CTRL + R) and see if that helps? 🙏
Slack,0,0,@agentserv We hear you! We're still considering multiline support and how best to implement it.
Slack,1,0,@alex_titcomb 👑👑
Slack,0,0,@Axman6 We're constantly working to improve CPU/memory use, but unfortunately more teams mean more CPU and memory usage. 😔
Slack,0,0,@abelovai How u do dis? 😮 Joking aside, where are you seeing this and does a refresh clear it (CMD/CTRL + R)?
Slack,0,0,@cjsbishop You should find something to suit your needs with a quick search in our app directory: https://t.co/Nk7QadF1Au. ✨
Slack,0,0,@CullenRPeterson 😘
Slack,0,0,@codeOfRobin Argh, sorry for the hassle. 😔 If the unread indicator refuses to clear, pressing shift + esc from the desktop should help. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@seven8time A most interesting idea. We'll be happy to share it with the team, thanks for sharing! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@skpodila It may help a little, but we wouldn't expect a major impact. We're working hard to reduce power usage, thanks for your patience. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@jxpx777 Yikes, that's confusing! 🤔 Maybe a cache clear will help. 🙏 Swipe left to Settings > Advanced > tap Reset Cache.
Slack,1,0,@spicer 🤝
Slack,2,0,@spicer Two more, Christian. Both Giphy-enabled, of course.
Slack,0,0,@dianatchow Hey now, Diana, some may say you're lucky! 😽 To explain, when you're on one team, we need space for the Mac traffic lights.
Slack,1,0,@eibcb Well, that's a good idea — we'll keep it in mind! Thanks for bearing with our current emoji set for now. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@TonyTalksTech Ah, we hear ya, Tony. No set plans right now, but we're definitely aware that logging into multiple teams should be easier.
Slack,0,0,@dianatchow Ah, not when you're signed in to one team, but it should hide itself when you're signed into two or more Slack teams!
Slack,2,0,@Wall_Doough Sorry — still no plans for this! How about making a custom, larger 💯 emoji? https://t.co/IH91LT64Bj
Slack,0,0,@TonyTalksTech Oh, like having one SSO login that signs you into multiple teams?
Slack,1,0,@jonnaro Ooh sorry about that— that definitely is annoying. We'll share this with the team 🙇
Slack,2,0,@investFeed Thanks! We'll be in touch to discuss it further shortly.
Slack,0,0,@nicksergeant Thanks Nick! Hopefully we'll be able to get to the bottom of this! We really appreciate your time on this.
Slack,1,0,@JkaplanAW Anytime!
Slack,0,0,@nicksergeant That's so odd! We can't seem to get this result on our end. We're happy to dig in further if you like: https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,0,0,@codygoodermote @f Not at the moment— it's still something we're looking at on our side. Sorry for the wait 🙇
Slack,2,0,@JkaplanAW Sure! Give this a try! https://t.co/GLHxcDfHUt
Slack,1,0,@investFeed Hmm, we'd like to take a closer look. Can you please write us at feedback@slack.com? Thanks!
Slack,23,0,@rrhoover Who us? 😱
Slack,1,0,@nicksergeant Oh shoot! Glad to hear that's sorted. Have you tried uploading since the one that didn't finish when the app was backgrounded?
Slack,1,0,@toddbodene Not as such, but we'll let the team now you'd like to be able to do this again!
Slack,1,0,@nicksergeant Also, were you using a share extension in this case? If possible, a screenshot of what you're seeing would be very helpful 🙏
Slack,1,0,@nicksergeant This has us stumped as we can't seem to repro this. Can we ask which version you're running? 🙇
Slack,2,0,@warpedsoul We can assure you that all the keyboards were treated with the utmost care and only the kindest of key-taps!
Slack,1,0,@toddbodene Ahh, got it. Our new app doesn't support this anymore, and it's not something we are able to add back just yet. 😞
Slack,0,0,@KerrickLong Oh how strange! We'll look into it— thank you!
Slack,1,0,@misskph Oh that's great news! 💖
Slack,1,0,@toddbodene Hmm... are you hoping for a find-and-replace feature in Slack? Or are we misunderstanding? 🤔
Slack,1,0,@tamouse Sorry about that! 🙈  Each team is its own entity for security reasons, but we'll take this to the team to consider.
Slack,2,0,@tooky Not right now, but it's something we're looking into! We like to use the All Unreads view after vacation for easy catch-up. 🌴
Slack,1,0,@erwstout Hmm... that doesn't sound right. Do you mind writing in to feedback@slack.com so we can take a closer look?
Slack,0,0,@erwstout That's no good! 😰 No long-standing issues that we know of. Is this on your mobile or desktop app (or both)?
Slack,0,0,@jc00ke Only team owners can edit the retention settings for public channels.
Slack,0,0,@TheRealHqmza 😱 Could you send a screenshot of that over to feedback@slack.com please?
Slack,0,0,@Raz0rCandy No plans for that right now but it's certainly something to think about! 🤔
Slack,0,0,@maloney_ws Thanks for letting us know!
Slack,0,0,@jc00ke Is it a public or private channel you're trying to change the settings for?
Slack,0,0,@jc00ke The team owner may have turned off the option to "Allow Channel Overrides."
Slack,2,0,@JaredSilver Sadly, yes.
Slack,1,0,@JaredSilver Sorry about that, it's a known bug. Signing out and signing back in to the team should fix it.
Slack,1,0,@wendrowski We don't have any plans for that right now but we'll let the team know that's something you'd like to see.
Slack,0,0,@KerrickLong So, the situation is someone left a channel but they were immediately invited back into the channel by another user?
Slack,0,0,@anthonyvardiz Only time will tell....
Slack,2,0,@_Cooper You can use cmd/ctrl+shift+k to begin a new group DM.
Slack,1,0,@netgeek_sprawl Not out for all teams just yet. We're rolling it out gradually.
Slack,0,0,@eeue56 You can get in touch at feedback@slack.com. 📨 ✨
Slack,0,0,@Becckitt Hmm, that's a new idea. We can definitely think about it.
Slack,1,0,@cauvee Please write to feedback@slack.com and our team will look into what's happening.
Slack,1,0,@hex Ah, you'd like to see Windows style emoji added to the list of options in Preferences > Messages & Media > Emoji Style?
Slack,2,0,@JessVerSteeg We don't have any plans for that right now but it's a neat idea! 💡
Slack,1,0,@markjharvey Please write to feedback@slack.com and we'll help with this.
Slack,0,0,@Anderson760 So noted! 📝 We'll discuss this with the team.
Slack,0,0,@nikbrb We don't mean to make you sad! 😕
Slack,0,0,@hex Sorry, not sure exactly what you mean. Are you having issues viewing emoji on Windows?
Slack,0,0,@RusCantCode Please drop a line to feedback@slack.com with your team details and we'll look into this.
Slack,0,0,@diegodossantos We can help! Could you please write in to feedback@slack.com so we can get details?
Slack,1,0,@schmichael We're working on it, sorry it's a bit sparse right now. We're also rolling out keyboard navigation as we speak. ⌨️✨
Slack,0,0,@hitandrepair That would need some careful thought from our product people; we'll let them know you're interested. 🐹
Slack,1,0,@SinaBahram Thanks for that! We know we have a few things to tweak with this, thanks for your patience.
Slack,0,0,@ShadowmarN Thanks for the feedback, and we will let the team know about both of these things!
Slack,0,0,@tckscz Thanks for letting us know you'd like to see this!
Slack,0,0,@navinvarma  👍
Slack,2,0,@biffbiffbiff We're thinking about it! 🤓
Slack,0,0,@AlexSorokoletov You can have it open in a tab in a browser, but if you are using the desktop app, you can use the Quick Switcher.
Slack,392,143,Slack now supports keyboard navigation so you can you get work done, the way you want to work #a11y #changelog… https://t.co/o9Q8TxIeMn
Slack,0,0,@GroundControl Oh dear, could you please write in? We can help! ✨
Slack,0,0,@WriterAHaughton So sorry! It's a bug we're working on! 🐛
Slack,0,0,@basicBrogrammer Thanks for being patient! The team is considering the best way forward on this! 🙌
Slack,0,0,@misskph We'll be happy to help!! You will have to write in so we can get some details: feedback@slack.com
Slack,0,0,@terencehuynh We think you might be running into a known issue! So sorry, but could you write in! feedback@slack.com 📓
Slack,0,0,@Adewale_Bobby Is there something that might work here? https://t.co/aJgu4Fhmr4
Slack,0,0,@alex_simpson93 In `Preferences > Messages and Media > inline Media and Links` you can change things to make this easier! 🙌
Slack,0,0,@timbhison Each team is a discrete unit and needs its own login and password for security purposes! 🔐
Slack,0,0,@navinvarma Oh dear! Nothing on our end, but we've written you back for more info. 🙌
Slack,0,0,@birkinbadxx psst. . .If your team has it enabled: https://t.co/PLY41JVO7n
Slack,0,0,@mimllr We do give you some control over who can @-channel at https://t.co/YPuK7R34ca under Messaging. Does that help at all?
Slack,1,0,@WinningFactory Sure would. We'll share it with the team; we're not sure it's possible right now but we can always think about it.
Slack,0,0,@rusbra We've got an open issue affecting one large team; mind telling us what team you're on?
Slack,1,0,@AlexSorokoletov Here you go! 🙌 https://t.co/UEyNkmqr7C
Slack,0,0,@jearvon Oh dear, everything seems ok here, could you write in so we can check your connectivity? feedback@slack.com
Slack,0,0,@terencehuynh Yikes! What mobile device is this happening on? Do you find that clearing cache for Slack in phone settings helps?
Slack,0,0,@tyrann0us It's not possible, but that's an interesting idea! We'll think about how to improve this experience. ✨
Slack,0,0,@umop_episdn_wi We're sorry it's not working out for you — while you can't do this right now we'll pass the suggestion to the team.
Slack,0,0,@AndrewHusband Oh dear! What seems to be happening with your app, and what version is this on?
Slack,0,0,@porada That's odd. Mind dropping us a line to feedback@slack.com so that we can have a closer look? 🕵️
Slack,1,0,@Hughesy67 We limit it on every other day too. 🙊 Joking aside, we have to limit it somewhere, and 23 is a nice prime number!
Slack,0,0,@ohcibi Yikes, does Help > Reset App Data make a difference? Note that this will sign you out of all teams.
Slack,1,0,@ALeKaizer We've no ETA on this, but it's something that the team is investigating. Sorry for the hassle!
Slack,1,0,@PrihanaBhasin Aw, you're making us blush! 😊💖💅
Slack,0,0,@MUSAB_F_ Do you mean a voice message in the channel? It’s not currently on the roadmap, but we’ll consider it for the future.
Slack,1,0,@Rhiannon_SJones Sure! To clear all unread notifications in Slack, just use Shift + Esc on desktop. 🙈
Slack,0,0,@jaCattell If you could drop a line to feedback@slack.com, we can take a closer look at this for you! 🙏
Slack,1,0,@AdamJCMurray Alas, while we use the unicode standard for emoji, we're not up to date. We're working on it though, so please bear with us! 🐻
Slack,0,0,@SpaceRocketPH 🙌🎈
Slack,0,0,@jaCattell There's no limit on number, but there are restrictions on the types of domain that can be added.
Slack,0,0,@jaCattell As in, how many teams you can sign up for?
Slack,2,0,@hypermkt Sure — no worries 👍
Slack,1,0,@JelenaVavavoum Yup ➕
Slack,0,0,@reynaldborer It isn't, but that's an interesting idea — thanks! We'll make a note 👍
Slack,0,0,@sjdix0n Hmm, that's most odd! 🤔 Can you please write us at feedback@slack.com so that we can dig a bit deeper into this? ⛏️
Slack,1,0,@namasteronak Why thank you! You don't look so bad yourself. 💕
Slack,5,0,@Barbnerdy We don’t have a hard limit on team sizes, except maybe, the sky. Get it? The sky’s the limit?.... Sorry.
Slack,0,0,@sfhosley Gah, sorry for the hassle. 😔 We hear you, and we're working on it. Hold tight! 🙇🙏
Slack,0,0,@mosbacher Ooh, nice idea! 💡 We've passed this feature request on to the team, thanks for sharing!  😍🙏✨
Slack,0,0,@manavm1990 Argh that's super frustrating, sorry! 😔 If you set your zoom to 100% and reopen the Post, does this fix things? 🙏
Slack,45,5,@ProductHunt @WorldEmojiDay Dunno — still thinking about it. You? https://t.co/nSTicVzETP
Slack,1,0,@scotinthecity Thank you for bringing this to our attention! ⭐️ We're looking into it. 🚧
Slack,0,0,@PWButt That team-wide setting can be adjusted by team owners and admins. Details here: https://t.co/sevtrfGgHp
Slack,0,0,@PWButt If the team-wide setting to hide it is enabled, you will be the only person who can see your email address.
Slack,0,0,@Aly_Jwd This might be helpful to you. Either way, we're very sorry that we've made your workflow trickier. We'll pass the feedback along.
Slack,0,0,@Aly_Jwd Sorry, no. Apologies for the confusion! Archive links now scroll back to messages in the desktop app instead of opening in browser.
Slack,0,0,@_johnott_ So sorry, John! 😔 We're working on it. 🔨🐛 For now, signing out of the duplicated teams then back in should tidy this up.
Slack,0,0,@Matonias Oof, we're so sorry. 😓 Please hold tight. 🐞🛠
Slack,0,0,@Naamenism 👋 We're here to help if you have any questions! 🌷
Slack,0,0,@science_of_life Head to https://t.co/ZpLTzsB134 and click on the Giphy integration, then uncheck the box for 'Enable Giphy previews'. 🎲💫
Slack,1,0,@miyagawa Not right now, unfortunately. Sorry!
Slack,1,1,@imSK24 Oh, thank you! You're making us blush. 😽 You're pretty excellent yourself, friend. ⭐️
Slack,0,0,@porada Hmm, please open it and click the 'More Items' button in the top right corner. Is there an unread message under 'What's New'? 🔘🔍
Slack,0,0,@troyd Thanks for the details and for bringing this to our attention, Troy! 😊 We'll look into it. 🕵️
Slack,0,0,@PWButt 👋😃 You can change your email address here: https://t.co/99dogY2qDA. Otherwise, the option to hide it is a team-wide preference.
Slack,0,0,@ProjectDavis Yikes, this is an annoying one, and we're sorry for the trouble. Please reinstall Slack and let us know if it continues 😩
Slack,0,0,@the_hepster In this case, can you please write in to feedback@slack.com? We'll want to take a closer look at your account. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@syeefk We agree. 😉
Slack,0,0,@the_hepster Thanks! When you open the team, do you see the badge on a specific DM or channel, or is it only on the team icon?
Slack,0,0,@Beryllium9 @lsmith Many apologies for the inconvenience! 😞 We know this is a huge pain. Thanks so much for your patience.
Slack,0,0,@the_hepster Sorry about this! 😥 Do you see the unread messages badge in desktop as well, or only mobile? And what type of mobile device?
Slack,1,0,@syeefk Sorry about this! We're working on making this only *necessarily* hard. Or possibly not hard at all. ✨
Slack,1,0,@elsattar Nope! You can join here: https://t.co/mTg6csgsLA. Thanks for your help! 💖
Slack,1,0,@kvakes Sorry about this— we're not drunk, just a little confused. This is a known bug! 🐛
Slack,0,0,@lsmith Sorry about this— it's a known bug. 🐛 Please sign out then back in to those teams on your iOS app. We're working on a fix now!
Slack,0,0,@troyd Darn! 🙈 Do both accounts where that tool tip was shown have the same email address?
Slack,0,0,@fredrikwestmark Sorry— this is a known bug! 🐛 Please sign out then back in to those teams. We're working on a fix now. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@Matonias Sorry about this! 🐛 Please sign out then back in to those teams. You'll only have one of each team, but still be double awesome. 💖
Slack,0,0,@rtukpe Sounds like a new bug we're dealing with. Do you mind writing in to feedback@slack.com so we can take a closer look? 🙇
Slack,0,0,@sys0dm1n Does the new Custom Status feature help? 🤔
Slack,0,0,@SpaceRocketPH Not that we know of! 🙈 What seems to be going on for you?
Slack,0,0,@rtukpe Sorry about this! Can you please try hitting `shift` + `esc` from that team to clear the badge? 🤔
Slack,0,0,@Aly_Jwd We're wondering if you've tried our desktop app? 🤔 Future updates might feel more intuitive for you: https://t.co/RvUnYTicJJ. 💖
Slack,1,0,@PyKat_Tweets  Sorry about the trouble - we are working on this bug as we speak! Thanks for your patience. 🙏
Slack,0,0,@tonyoramos1 The badge will represent the last team you actively visited!
Slack,0,0,@nykollam Sorry about the trouble! We're working hard to fix this pesky bug. Thank you for your patience.🙌
Slack,0,0,@andrewonwx  There is an active bug on iPhone we are working on as well. We’ll have things back to normal as quickly as we can. 👊
Slack,0,0,@craigmcd10  Sorry about the trouble! Our team is working to resolve this bug ASAP
Thanks for your patience!
Slack,1,0,@calebhailey  Got it. We'll pass it along!
Slack,0,0,@fribeiro1 There was a blip a few of days ago, but if you're still having troubles, can you email feedback@slack.com for us to investigate?
Slack,0,0,@Aly_Jwd We retired it so that users wouldn't have to jump between app & browser all the time, but we hear you and will share your feedback.
Slack,0,0,@calebhailey Thanks for your feedback! We'll let the team know you'd like to see so more theme settings in the future👌
Slack,0,0,@windowswebdev How curious! Please do let us know if it re-appears. And thank *you* for troubleshooting. :)
Slack,0,0,@TaimurAbdaal sent via a GET request. Sorry! We'll certainly pass this along as a feature request for you though. 2/2
Slack,0,0,@TaimurAbdaal We require a JSON payload to be sent for incoming webhooks, so it isn't currently possible for incoming webhooks to be 1/2
Slack,0,0,@e_maniacs Try asking Slackbot "file upload" or "how do I upload files". 2/2 🌟
Slack,0,0,@e_maniacs You've actually searched for the words "file upload" in your team's history. If you'd like to find out *how* to upload files 1/2
Slack,1,0,@absolutwillie Not in the App Directory, but you might have luck with a 3rd party app. Try a Google search for "Evernote Slack integration".
Slack,1,0,@Singsalad Sorry about the trouble! Can you please drop us a line at feedback@slack.com? We'd like to dig deeper for you. 🙏
Slack,0,0,@Rokashi You can check out our current offerings here! 👉 https://t.co/UzXwhFXn7i
Slack,0,0,@AaronKurzak  And thanks for sharing your ideas. We appreciate it!
Slack,1,0,@HornAndreas  Hey thanks! 💗
Slack,0,0,@stormsweeper  Thanks for the detail. We'll pass this along!
Slack,0,0,@mrmess @jozenc  We’re exploring this idea, so stay tuned.🙏
Slack,0,0,@AaronKurzak  Not on the roadmap at this time, but that would be sensible! We'll pass your suggestion to the team for consideration. 🙏
Slack,0,0,@scionofbytes We're trying our best, but there is always room for improvement. 😔 We'll pass your feedback to the team.
Slack,0,0,@windowswebdev Heh. Sorry about that. Does it go away if your refresh your app (CNRTL + R key)?
Slack,0,0,@codingkapoor Hmm, there should be a setting for Linux app badges. Can you email feedback@slack.com for us to troubleshoot this with you?
Slack,1,0,@alangrow No. 🐢🐢🐢
Slack,1,1,@jsadn Cat videos on repeat, bliss! We'll let the team know you'd like inline Instagram videos to loop, but for now: https://t.co/PV6cc4rlsN
Slack,0,0,@OnsonSweemey  Hmm sorry for the trouble! Can you drop us a line at feedback@slack.com? We'd like to dig deeper for you. 🙏
Slack,0,0,@AxiaCorp Thanks for the suggestion! No plans right now but we'll let the team know you'd like to see in the future. 🙏
Slack,0,0,@nickfishman 🇬🇧☕
Slack,0,0,@stormsweeper Sorry, we'll share your feedback over to the team. Was there anything in particular you didn't like about it?
Slack,1,0,@nkoder  Oh dear, sorry about the trouble! The team is aware of this issue and working on a fix. Thanks for your patience! 🙏
Slack,24,0,@cabel That's okay. We were also like ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
Slack,0,0,@Aly_Jwd We'll certainly let the team know your feedback. Sorry that bulk delete option disappeared when we retired the /archives page.
Slack,0,0,@vmalloc That would be sensible! Thanks for your suggestion - we'll pass this along to the team. 😃
Slack,0,0,@DexxPalmer Yikes, sorry for the troubles. What app are you using? Is it just photos that are failing, or do all files fail to send? 😭
Slack,1,0,@semaphore_P So many indeed! We'll pass this suggestion on to the team for you. ✌
Slack,1,0,@JSn1nj4 @SiAdcock Noted. We'll share your feedback with the team. 🙇
Slack,2,0,@vermicelli That's fair feedback! We'll share this with the team. Thank you 💖
Slack,0,0,@jvusa You're too kind! Thank you, John 😊
Slack,8,0,@annapickard @chrismessina @OyeAnuj Anna! Surely they're all mostly washed.
Slack,1,0,@ccnokes https://t.co/ZUcmamzCl1
Slack,0,0,@andrewonwx Oh dear! We do have some bug fixes in our next release that should help with this. Sorry for the trouble!
Slack,1,0,@islaisreading It's basically the same thing, but with a touch fewer muffled, crackly noises.
Slack,0,0,@tahorg Thanks for the feedback! We'll give it some thought 💡
Slack,1,0,@thekenyeung Oh, Ken, it's not just you. You're in good company 😉
Slack,1,0,@thekenyeung It's all subjective! Some of us need to do a lot of talking to our teammates throughout the day— no harm in that! 💖
Slack,0,0,@MarkV Ah, this preference is only adjustable in a browser or on the desktop, not on mobile— sorry for the confusion!
Slack,0,0,@Casey_Royals ...designate a different channel as #general so that you can delete the old one.
Slack,0,0,@Casey_Royals Hmm, well you could manually delete each one, or if you write us at feedback@slack.com, we might be able to...
Slack,0,0,@bradsk88 Please get in touch at feedback@slack.com and our Platform team will help.
Slack,72,5,Extra insider tip: For power users, the “Show unreads and starred channels” option is basically the greatest thing since toast. #slacktips
Slack,0,0,@kkostov Oh no, that's not very nice at all. Did you recently run a call by any chance? If you quit and relaunch the app does that help? 🤔
Slack,49,3,Sidebar options, previously in "Prefs > Advanced options", are now in "Prefs > Sidebar". Which seems, in retrospect… https://t.co/diMptF08Nx
Slack,0,0,@nanoanno Sorry, we don't have a timeline. We're working to fix it as quickly as we can.
Slack,1,0,@angelchrys Email invitations for full team members won't expire. So they'll be good to accept it on Monday.
Slack,1,0,@dbproductionLtd You make a very good point here. We'll think about that. 🤔
Slack,1,0,@jmcquarrie Thank you!
Slack,0,0,@angelchrys That varies depending on how the link was set up. Did you receive an email invitation that has expired?
Slack,0,0,@nanoanno Sorry for the trouble, that is a known issue. You can work around it by using the "+" in the message input box to upload files.
Slack,0,0,@jmcquarrie Unfortunately it sounds like you've run into a known bug. 😕 Our team is working to fix it as quickly as we can.
Slack,3,0,@plightbo Try the up arrow!
Slack,1,0,@jonathanlally So noted! Thanks for letting us know it's something you'd really like to see.
Slack,1,0,@mvanhulten Please let us know if you have any questions or if we can help with anything!
Slack,0,0,@hodgesmr You should be able to right click on the timestamp to copy the link.
Slack,4,0,@getspoke 😳 We're still thinking about this...
Slack,2,0,@AlexTalks That would be a Slack team. You then have channels within your team.
Slack,0,0,@ohayon Sorry, that bug is still open and the team is working to get it fixed ASAP, though we have no ETA to share at the moment.
Slack,0,0,@jmadlena We'll let the team know that's something you'd like to see! 📝
Slack,1,1,@msgilligan We do have some CPU bug fixes in our next release, which we hope will help with CPU use.
Slack,0,0,@DevKaoru The settings are dependent on the app. Could you write in to feedback@slack.com for us to take a look?
Slack,0,0,@dloehr Thank you kindly!
Slack,0,0,@msgilligan Sorry Sean, we're constantly working to improve CPU/memory use, but unfortunately for now more teams does = more CPU & memory. 😔
Slack,0,0,@jmcquarrie Good to know. Are you seeing this behavior in a browser or in the desktop app? Which platform?
Slack,0,0,@AnimationMerc There isn't a way to differentiate those, sorry. They'll both trigger the same badges, sounds and banners.
Slack,0,0,@OfficialPerEra Please drop a line to feedback@slack.com with the team details and we'll help.
Slack,0,0,@AntoineAugusti Thank YOU for taking the time to write in! 📝🙇💖
Slack,0,0,@jmcquarrie Does clicking the `x` in the blue "New messages" banner, or hitting `esc` in the channel, work to mark messages as read?
Slack,1,0,@scottjohnson @kalebhermes We retired the /archives page, but Owners/Admins can delete Public Channels as follows: https://t.co/qXilN9LNyX
Slack,0,0,@AntoineAugusti Darn! This is a known bug. Can you please write in to feedback@slack.com so we can manually clear it for you? 🙇
Slack,1,0,@mustonen_jussi Thanks for taking the time to do that! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@scottjohnson ... archived right now (also by Admins/Owners, or the user who created the channel). Does that help? (2/2)
Slack,0,0,@dloehr Odd! Do you find you're able to clear them? Could we trouble you to write in to feedback@slack.com for us to investigate this one? 🙏
Slack,1,0,@scottjohnson Public channels can be deleted by team Admins/Owners from the Channel Settings menu. 🙃 Private channels can only be... (1/2)
Slack,1,0,@bartn_ Ah, it's kept separate to ensure user deactivation isn't done lightly/accidentally, but we'll share your experience with the team. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@AntoineAugusti Sorry about that! 🙈 Can you please head up to the Help option in the top menubar, then select Clear Cache and Restart?
Slack,0,0,@jmcquarrie Oh dear! Let's double check your settings! In Preferences >  Mark as Read tab, is one of the "mark as read" options selected?
Slack,0,0,@mustonen_jussi Darn! Can you please write in to feedback@slack.com so we can take a closer look?
Slack,0,0,@momo_ops Thank you for the kind words! ✨
Slack,0,0,@bartn_ You can filter this page by Username / email address to search for, and deactivate specific accounts. 2/2
Slack,0,0,@bartn_ No way to ban accounts from channels, but deactivating users will stop them from logging into your team: https://t.co/kbuY9wibTN 1/2
Slack,0,0,@dloehr Do you notice phantom badges every time the app updates? Were you able to clear the badge? 🤔
Slack,0,0,@ZheenB You should have gotten a confirmation email from us when you submitted. 🤔
Slack,0,0,@GandalfsBaby Spell check doesn't autocorrect at the moment, just underlines incorrect spelling, but we'll pass the feedback along for you.
Slack,1,0,@TGBGclan ... here: https://t.co/w8ppVX9EC2. Please ask those with connectivity issues to write in to feedback@slack.com. (2/2)
Slack,1,0,@TGBGclan Ahh, got it. Sounds like your team has reached the file storage maximum. Your teammates can delete files to free up space... (1/2)
Slack,1,0,@AxiaCorp Understandable! We'll have a think on it!
Slack,0,0,@zckkntr Unfortunately no, this is still an existing issue. 😭 So sorry for the wait!
Slack,1,0,@MalarieGokey 😂
Slack,1,0,@TGBGclan No widespread connectivity issues that we're aware of today! 😰 What happens when you try to post a picture?
Slack,1,0,@zkahn Thank you for sharing this idea! We don't have immediate plans to make nested channels, but we'll pass this along to the team! ✌
Slack,1,0,@purrdeta We do that too. All. The. Time. 😅
Slack,0,0,@tylertypewriter Thanks for writing in so we can investigate this for you. 🙇
Slack,1,0,@GJordanDetamore Ahh, got it! Unfortunately there's no way right now, but we'll pass this request along to the product team. 🕗
Slack,1,0,@TheNickBlackmon You can find them here: https://t.co/vhPGzZ7F7D. 👣😊
Slack,0,0,@mustonen_jussi 😱 Let's try resetting your cache! In Slack, follow this path: Settings > Advanced > Reset local storage.
Slack,1,0,@OtyMartin Aw shucks! You're pretty great too! 💖
Slack,0,0,@OfficialPerEra That's no good! What happens when you try to log in? Do you get an error?
Slack,0,0,@mbrevoort Thanks for this neat idea! We'll pass it along!  ✨
Slack,0,0,@Aly_Jwd We hear you and we appreciate this feedback about the archives. Thank you. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@dubstrike Mind giving this a try? 🙏  Let us know if you still can't tap into channels!
Slack,0,0,@dubstrike Oh no! Let's try resetting the cache! To do this, follow these steps: iOS Settings > Slack > toggle Reset Cache on Next Launch.
Slack,1,0,@HeySarahSpencer No problem at all! Have a lovely day! ✨
Slack,1,0,@IanScarffe Oh oops. 😅 Follow this path: Preferences > Messages & Media tab > Inline Media and Links header at the bottom!
Slack,0,0,@Zenga55 Is that so? 🤔
Slack,1,0,@primakat Ah, fantastic! 💚✨
Slack,0,0,@mr_majyck Noted! We'll give it more thought. Thanks for the great feedback! 🌟
Slack,2,0,@olivierlacan That's a good idea and something we're thinking about! We're sorry about the bother in the meantime. 🚂⏰
Slack,1,0,@tylertypewriter Sorry for the trouble! We might need more info to investigate further. Do you mind writing in at https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X?
Slack,0,0,@Aly_Jwd It's no longer possible, that's right! Sorry about that.
Slack,0,0,@Smudge202 Thanks for that info, Tommy. We'll share that along with the team here! (No Windows key sorry, just Ctrl+V)
Slack,0,0,@JnBrymn Understood. Thank you for the honest feedback John!
Slack,0,0,@Smudge202 Ah sorry about that, Tommy. 😞 Where are you copying text from?
Slack,0,0,@wabmaster Understood, thanks — we'll note this as a request for the team. Sorry not to have a better answer here 🙌
Slack,1,0,@Singmyr Thanks very much! 💕
Slack,0,0,@wabmaster But … not close enough? 😱
Slack,0,0,@Singmyr Ah, sorry. Would it be possible to write in with more details? We'll take a look: https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,1,0,@Smudge202 Sorry about that! Does pasting with Ctrl Windows Key V instead help?
Slack,0,0,@wabmaster This sounds kiiiiiin'a like: https://t.co/e8iT8LLAlv
Slack,0,0,@Singmyr Oh no! Thanks for flagging! Is this in a mobile browser? Any one in particular? 🤔
Slack,0,0,@MrSimonBennett https://t.co/60ZyCtnTX0
Slack,2,0,@JnBrymn You can unfollow a thread by opening it and selecting the … menu on the source message, then "Unfollow thread" — does that help? ⚗️
Slack,0,0,@mongoaron A muted channel should still show a badge if you're mentioned or if there's a keyword — do you want full notifications, though?
Slack,0,0,@mluggy Hello! How do you mean?
Slack,3,0,@minecoder This is definitely something we're looking into 😎
Slack,0,0,@JeremyZahner Sorry about that! We're doing a lot of work to improve Posts right now. Please bear with us — we're making progress! 😅
Slack,1,0,@mahemoff There isn't — sorry about that! We'll note this as a request for the team, though 🙌
Slack,0,0,@aaroncornish Oh no, how annoying! We can check that out for you if you'd like to drop us a line to feedback@slack.com? Thanks! ❤️
Slack,0,0,@ZeroDistraction Sorry about that! These should return in the next beta release 👍
Slack,1,0,@vintagebazaarOB Thanks for the heads-up — please do drop us a line on this if you haven't already 🙇
Slack,0,0,@AxiaCorp You can use Cmd Or Control and the team number to quickly jump between teams. Does that help?
Slack,0,0,@tamapugsley If it's a link to an image it'll expand, but not file uploads right now! Sorry about that.
Slack,0,0,@vintagebazaarOB Not as such, sorry. But please do write in if your team is seeing problems: https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,0,1,@mazunoko8Cocoa Sorry about that! Removing and re-adding the integration may help. But please let us know if not 🙌
Slack,1,0,@AliceTlg @adamnash This ought to do the trick! https://t.co/up3gsrl1qu 🎉🎉
Slack,0,0,@nuttakorn We agree, it could be quite useful! No firm plans just yet, but it's absolutely something we're considering. 🖼️
Slack,1,0,@slinkywhat It's quite a difficult balance, no doubt! There's no way to force notifications through, but it's something we can consider. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@Tezamondo No worries!
Slack,1,0,@Tezamondo Not on the Free plan, but for teams on the Standard or Plus plan, Admins and Team Owners can update members' email addresses. 📬
Slack,0,0,@slinkywhat That's right. They can change their notifications to receive 'Nothing', compared to 'All new messages' or 'Just mentions'. 📢
Slack,0,0,@icecreamtamales Hmm, you should be able to upload multiple images on desktop. 🤔 Mind letting us know which version of the app you're using?
Slack,0,0,@Raz0rCandy Unfortunately not! We can see how this would be handy though — we'll share this with the team. 🙌
Slack,1,0,@tpope Apologies again, Tim. We'll share your feedback with the team and hopefully we can improve this in future. 🙏
Slack,0,0,@chemdrew No worries at all! It's what we're here for. 😄
Slack,0,0,@chemdrew Hmm, this sounds similar to our user groups feature. Check it out here ➡️ https://t.co/hcACFGYqyZ
Slack,0,0,@tim_kite Ahh, sorry for being a battery hog! We're continually working on improvements to the app's performance. Stay tuned! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@cmoiseve That first draft just has to be in the ball park. 😎⚾️🏌
Slack,1,0,@richardpenner Lots of things have quarters! We think Tina was talking about a social basketball team. Oranges were definitely involved. 🏀🍊🗑
Slack,0,0,@while42 It's all looking good from our side, though it's your side that counts! Can you write in? We'll get this fixed. feedback@slack.com
Slack,0,0,@staringispolite We'd be super appreciative if you don't mind writing in to help us debug this one. ➡️ https://t.co/KsR6mZY2hf 😊🙇
Slack,0,0,@graffr_ Gotcha. We've passed this all across to the team. Thanks again for sharing. 😊🙌
Slack,1,0,@mmmdailey Our pleasure! Don't be a stranger now. 😎💖⛷
Slack,2,0,@tpope Unfortunately. 😞 Sorry for the inconvenience here, Tim. It's not a personal setting because it needs to be consistent team-wide.
Slack,1,0,@jc00ke Okay! We'll think about it. Thanks for sharing. ⭐️
Slack,1,0,@mmmdailey Or, even better, turn off Slack mobile push notifications from Slack. (Swipe left > Settings > Notifications > "Nothing").
Slack,0,0,@mmmdailey Ah! This is expected, actually. We use Apple's push servers, so you'd want to turn off mobile data at the system level.
Slack,1,0,@dvidsilva @estebanuribe Sorry about that! It's a known bug that we're working to fix for future versions of our app. 😓
Slack,0,0,@jc00ke And you'd like the image to actually animate when you click the zoom button?
Slack,0,0,@jc00ke Hmmm! So you have "Alllow animated images & emoji" unchecked under Preferences > Accessibility, correct? 🦄
Slack,2,0,@joconnell By wearing this shirt, you are about to notify 106 people in 11 timezones. Are you sure?
Slack,1,0,@itsjoekent Brilliant recommendation! We're considering how to best do this. Stay tuned! 😊
Slack,0,0,@jack_naglieri Do you want stories?
Slack,0,0,@graffr_ Thanks for letting us know! What would you like to see from the Dropbox integration?
Slack,0,0,@wr Working on it! Sorry for the wait!
Slack,0,0,@aevershed Have fun on your vacation! 😎
Slack,0,0,@mmmdailey Oh no! Sorry, Melissa. Could you clarify which types of messages you're getting alerted by? Are they Slack push notifications?
Slack,0,0,@estebanuribe We know, and we're sorry! Our team is working on fixing this bug in a future release. Thanks for your patience. 😓
Slack,0,0,@jbenton Makes sense!
Slack,0,0,@johnboxall Hmmmm. That's curious. Would you mind dropping us a line to feedback@slack.com? We'd love some more details. 🔎
Slack,1,0,@jbenton But you make a great point. We shall confer with our iOS team on this!
Slack,0,0,@jbenton Unfortunately, there's no way to set different notification preferences for iPad and iPhone. It's all mobile.
Slack,0,0,@icecreamtamales Thanks for the prompt on this. How are you uploading images? Through the desktop app, or via one of our mobile apps?
Slack,0,0,@fantasyfight Very sorry for the wait. We're still working on getting this fixed up. 😥
Slack,1,0,@InfoVizard Sorry for the troubles! Yes. We're aware of an issue with the Twitter integration, and our team is looking into it now. 😔
Slack,1,0,@HeySarahSpencer Hey Sarah! Unfortunately, Slack doesn't support linking local paths. Are you able to copy the URL and paste that instead?
Slack,0,0,@sauldraws Drat. We'll dig a bit deeper into this, but for now, this should be fixed by signing out and back into those duped teams. Sorry!
Slack,0,0,@graffr_ Wow, that's a great list! We'll pass it along to the rest of the folks here. 📝✨
Slack,0,0,@runsammrun In that case, try grabbing version 2.6.3, then hit the "Test your connection" link and see what it says if you're still stuck.
Slack,0,0,@thejeffbyrnes Ah, yes, sounds like it might be an alias your team's set up. We have quite the list of personal emoji aliases, ourselves!
Slack,0,0,@mcarriere Ack, we're definitely aware of this bug, alas. On a happier note, we're hoping to have it fixed up very soon! 📁💔
Slack,1,0,@GJordanDetamore Yes, but you'd have to be fairly explicit! As an example: /remind me tomorrow at 11 AM about brunch 😁🍳
Slack,1,0,@MurtenSaerbi Deleting files and messages can definitely be a bit of a hassle. Hopefully we can look at smoothing that out in the future! 🚫📂
Slack,2,0,@dubstrike Drat! Thanks for the heads up on this: we've sent up a flag to our iOS team, and they're going to see if they can fix this up. 📱👌
Slack,1,0,@martinrogard Oh, that's a really interesting idea! We'll float this past the team here. Thanks for bringing it up! 🔐➡️📣
Slack,2,0,@dilip_dwarak Not just yet, but we'd be happy to pass your request along to the rest of the folks here at HQ!
Slack,1,1,@mattmittenthal Us, too! We also have a channel for dog owners, and one for folks who prefer the video game Overwatch to both cats and dogs.
Slack,1,0,@TerenaBell We have more than 5 million daily active users! It's quite a lot to keep up with, but we're doing our best. 🚀😅
Slack,0,0,@avemii You can actually grab those from our swag shop. All proceeds go to a good cause, too! ✨ https://t.co/UeY3D7U19s
Slack,0,0,@data_dave_r We get a lot of requests for that functionality! Hopefully we can look into something like that for a future release. 📝👍
Slack,0,0,@thejeffbyrnes Oh, there isn't a :sad: in our default list of emoji, which is likely why we change that to :disappointed: instead! 😅
Slack,56,23,Do your best work no matter where you are: Check out our Slack tips for remote and distributed workers. https://t.co/x7YbBRm4BH
Slack,1,0,@JaZrocks You can find them here: https://t.co/vhPGzZ7F7D! 👌🎉
Slack,0,0,@runsammrun It should be! 😅 Can you please command + r and let us know if that helps?
Slack,0,0,@jasontheblock Sorry about this! Do you mind writing in to feedback@slack.com so we can take a closer look?
Slack,1,0,@thehilker You can click on the `@` in the upper-right to see the activity feed, then click on the mention to jump directly to it.
Slack,0,0,@BM5k Lovely idea! We'll pass this along to the team for consideration. 🔕
Slack,0,0,@graffr_ Anything specific you'd you like to see? 🤔
Slack,1,0,@adamnash We're so relieved you followed our dress code so we don't have to turn you away.
 😅👣
Slack,1,0,@thalidanoel 🙈 Would you please get in touch at feedback@slack.com? We need to take a closer look into this.
Slack,0,0,@Sharkyl They should be alphabetical. Yours aren't? Could you send us a screenshot? We're at feedback@slack.com.
Slack,0,0,@tomforgacs Pssst, it's still here!
Slack,0,0,@sprout_sarah Oh that certainly doesn't sound right. Please get in touch at feedback@slack.com with your team details. We'll look into it.
Slack,0,0,@commadelimited Depending on team settings, standard users can also install Apps, so it's there for Non-Admins to use too.
Slack,0,0,@roach_iam Afraid we don't support consolidated logins across teams for security & administrative reasons. Sorry for the frustration!
Slack,0,0,@Hinchable Text substitutions should work. If you're having trouble with them please get in touch at feedback@slack.com.
Slack,0,0,@UncleDara We don't anchor them to a specific place and time in a channel. That said, the team is working to improve this. Stay tuned! 2/2 🌟
Slack,0,0,@UncleDara Ah, we don’t allow jumping to files from the Search/Activity pane because files can actually be shared in multiple places, so 1/2
Slack,0,0,@slinkywhat No, as notification settings are determined by user. This might help you with an announcement though: https://t.co/Eb7jPOgKZ0
Slack,0,0,@ArcathWhitefall ...https://t.co/3sGJ1fPxTQ 2/2
Slack,0,0,@ArcathWhitefall Sorry, we don't have a bulk deletion feature. You might be interested in custom file retention options: ... 1/2
Slack,1,0,@kaftoot Here, or to feedback@slack.com, or by using the /feedback command. ✨
Slack,0,0,@staringispolite So sorry about this! Do you remember your exact steps? We want to try reproducing it for our engineers!
Slack,0,0,@michalmigurski Any unused teams might help in the meantime, as well as turning off animations in your teams (as you mentioned). 2/2
Slack,0,0,@sauldraws Yikes! Could you share with us your exact steps? We want to investigate for you. 🛠
Slack,0,0,@michalmigurski Ah, sorry for the troubles. More teams does = more CPU & memory use, but we are working to improve this. Signing out of 1/2
Slack,0,1,@kaftoot 😱 Goodness, no.
Slack,2,0,@DavidGranado No plans for a PWA just yet, but we'll let the team know you'd like to see it. ✨
Slack,1,0,@ProjectDavis Hmm, what device are you on? And what app version? (You should be able to see this from the menubar, under 'About Slack'.)
Slack,0,0,@shai_wininger Thanks so much! 💖
Slack,0,0,@punkeel Hmm, we haven't heard other reports of this. Could you ask your team member to email feedback@slack.com for us to troubleshoot? 🙇
Slack,2,0,@brentb_s @JoshAllegro Yikes! Can you email feedback@slack.com with this Tweet? The team will need to investigate this one for you. 🔍👀
Slack,0,0,@drusepth No ETA to share, but please stay tuned – we're working on it. 📻
Slack,1,0,@commadelimited No way to hide the APPS section, but we're listening to all feedback on the feature & will let the team know your thoughts.
Slack,0,0,@shai_wininger You can email in to feedback@slack.com in that case! We can look into what's going on a bit closer.
Slack,159,39,Get as much done in fewer clicks. Now you can grant access to G Drive files right from Slack. Neat. ✨ #changelog https://t.co/EuBg6bK0yo
Slack,0,0,@shai_wininger Our autocomplete weights people you talk to most often towards the top, then should list alphabetical by first name.
Slack,0,0,@Capn_Kurt 😱 Yikes! Could you try pushing the ESC button in that channel to mark everything as read?
Slack,0,0,@Hamsmuggla At this time, it isn't possible to remove the new Apps sidebar header. We do appreciate the feedback though! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@michalmigurski  😕  Mind letting us know which version of the app you're using?
Slack,1,0,@ojhodge For sure! What you're looking for is 'Interactive messages stage 3' https://t.co/8293RsnHw5
Slack,0,0,@gorirrajoe Not built in, but there may be some 3rd party apps and integrations out there that work with your music player of choice?
Slack,0,0,@StevieoG83 😭  Are you using version 3.23.1? This is our newest release.
Slack,0,0,@jasontheblock 😱  That is odd! Can you try resetting your cache? Swipe left to Settings > Advanced > tap Reset Cache.
Slack,0,0,@ojhodge Text input isn't something we offer just yet, but it's in our plans! Sorry about that.
Slack,0,0,@nicksergeant That's understandable! We're listening to feedback on this and we appreciate your thoughts. We'll pass them along!
Slack,0,0,@nicksergeant Ah, that's why! The App heading will remain empty unless you add a bot user. 👍
Slack,1,0,@daptronic Oh gosh, this has made our day. Here's a fun acapella version of the theme song! 🎵🎶🎧 https://t.co/FT4BH9aRx8
Slack,0,0,@ehthayer Not right now but this is a great idea! We'll pass the suggestion onwards and upwards so we can discuss further. 🙇 🙏
Slack,1,0,@KUThetaTau That could be incredibly useful! Thanks for sharing the thought – we will pass it on to the thinkers here as well. 🤔💭
Slack,0,0,@RealGeneKim We've no immediate plans for video calls on mobile but never say never! 🔮
Slack,0,0,@bmv437 We'd love to investigate to see what's been going wrong. Can you write in to feedback@slack.com with date & time of sample calls? 🙇
Slack,1,0,@jaysonlane If you would like to turn this off on mobile, you can tap into settings > advanced and toggle it off from here! ✨ 🙏
Slack,0,0,@jrrickard What a world that might have been! (Still, at least you can pet the piggy.) 😉
Slack,0,0,@captnforkbomb ...hesitate to share any feedback. Our Help Center also has some useful tips: https://t.co/kUtAGQUABv. 2/2
Slack,0,0,@captnforkbomb  We're sorry to hear threads isn't working well for your team. We are always looking into improvements so please don't... 1/2
Slack,3,0,@jeradrose Threads will be receiving several improvements along those lines. Thanks for your patience 'til then!
Slack,1,0,@easyaspython Will do, thanks!
Slack,0,0,@nicksergeant Any apps that have bot users will show up here. It helps to differentiate between human and bot users (among other things). 🤖
Slack,1,0,@zachfeldman Gracious, we're sorry for the confusion. 😞 It's not possible to link your teams together at the moment. Again, our apologies!
Slack,0,0,@dbozaan Your team may have chosen a different channel than #general for your default or they may have renamed the #general channel. 2/2
Slack,0,0,@dbozaan Your team's default channel is the one channel which every regular member is a part of. Useful for team announcements and news! 1/2
Slack,0,0,@PhilKocher @Davemrogers Absolutely. Would you be able to write in to feedback@slack.com so we can delve deeper into the particulars? 🙏 🙌
Slack,0,0,@ChrisSinjo If you can write in to us at feedback@slack.com with your team domain, we can take a look at clearing these. 👀 🙇
Slack,0,0,@bmv437 We're sorry for the trouble Brandon! Is this new as of right now? We're looking into some issues with connectivity at the moment.
Slack,0,0,@dnbmth Welcome to Slack! 🙌🏼😀
Slack,1,0,@easyaspython Afraid not, you'd need to delete the entire reminder. sorry about that!
Slack,1,0,@drew3ooo We'll pass this along to our team to look into! Thank you.
Slack,0,0,@MeaganAmy Here's a virtual cookie! 🍪
Slack,0,0,@Alexhorre More on that here:  https://t.co/k2Gld3U1H2 and h https://t.co/1WOiBBQI34. Let us know if you're still unsure. 🙏2/2
Slack,0,0,@drew3ooo We publish reports here if that's what you're looking for? https://t.co/cGEa71kufR
Slack,0,0,@Alexhorre The roles currently include; Primary Owner (creates/runs the overall team), and owners and admins. Permissions vary depending 1/2
Slack,0,0,@ChrisSinjo That's the one! You can also try Shift + Esc via a desktop and it should translate to mobile for you also. 🙏
Slack,0,0,@ChrisSinjo You're all up to date so. We're working on resolving this bug at present, but in the meantime does clearing the cache help?
Slack,0,0,@zachfeldman Can you please provide a little more information as to what you mean by link? Is it in terms of a unified login perhaps? 🤔
Slack,0,0,@ahs2oz Would you mind sharing this with feedback@slack.com so we can look into it more closely? Thanks! 2/2
Slack,0,0,@ahs2oz So when you click on the link do you get any errors or they just don't load? 1/2
Slack,0,0,@ben_bolyard No news we can share around this yet, sorry about that!
Slack,0,0,@chaos_monster No problem at all :)
Slack,1,0,@tonifisler We're working on it! Watch this space. 🙌
Slack,1,0,@wcski Admins on the team should be able to delete those!
Slack,1,0,@chaos_monster An owner should be able to do that for an admin, indeed!
Slack,0,0,@chaos_monster This option is available for all Owners — if you are an Admin you'll have to contact one of the Team Owners to do this.
Slack,2,0,@ChrisDeeBrown @sebastienrocks This is an elusive bug that we're working on at the moment — sorry for the frustration! 🐛🛠
Slack,0,0,@zivcjs Sorry about this pesky bug, it's proving difficult to track down. We are on the hunt, though! 🐛🔎
Slack,0,0,@UncleDara Hmm, is this from a search or somewhere else?
Slack,0,0,@zachfeldman Oof, that can be annoying, sorry! This happens as your teams aren't linked, but we'll look into how it can be improved.
Slack,1,0,@chaos_monster You should have the option to restrict people who can use @-channel and @-here, is that not showing for you?
Slack,0,0,@tpflug Ooh, excellent idea! It's not something we have, but it's certainly something to consider.
Slack,4,0,@birkinbadxx :heavy_plus_sign:
Slack,1,0,@jcampbell_05 Hmm, that's strange! 🤔 If you could please drop a line to feedback@slack.com we'll be able to investigate this.
Slack,1,0,@mbootsman Alas, at the moment you can only use this in Chrome, but we are bringing video calls to the Linux app soon! ✨
Slack,1,0,@Grossiaux We hear you! We’ll look into how it can be improved. 🌸
Slack,0,0,@hotlava69 It’s not currently on the roadmap, but we’ll consider it for the future. Thanks for the suggestion! 🙌
Slack,0,0,@chaos_monster Team Owners can restrict this at https://t.co/YPuK7R34ca. Go to Permissions > Messaging and expand for available options.
Slack,1,0,@phaus Not right now, but we're looking into more options for future updates!
Slack,0,0,@Codepope Thanks for the suggestions — we'll pass them on to the team. 🎈

Slack,0,0,@thatguymyles Oh yay — glad to hear that's all sorted. 💖
Slack,0,0,@ChrisSinjo Oh dear, that sounds like a bug we're working on. What version of the app are you on?
Slack,0,0,@Perezscript 🤗
Slack,0,0,@freakomonk That's so great to hear! 📞👂
Slack,0,0,@phaus Do you mean Slack status? https://t.co/OFNepucoxy
Slack,0,0,@joovlaki Sorry to hear you're still having this trouble! Please write to us at feedback@slack.com, we'll be glad to take a look.
Slack,0,0,@DarkDyson Yaaaaaay! 🙌 … @DanHanzus Booooooo! 👻 ... (but do let us know if we can help with anything!)

Slack,1,0,@aparejadorivan ¡Hola! Actualmente, no es posible mover un mensaje de un canal a un hilo, ¡pero nos parece una idea interesante!
Slack,0,0,@Codepope Unfortunately there's no way to remove it, sorry! But we're all ears when it comes to feedback 👂🏻
Slack,0,0,@isamariasmith  Sure thing! For the desktop app, you'll find that here: https://t.co/RvUnYTicJJ 💻
Slack,0,0,@product_daniel For sure! For any updates and changes we make, we list them here: https://t.co/hUsFJACnFK 👍🏻
Slack,0,0,@product_daniel Ooh, this would be useful for understanding communication internally. Thanks, Daniel — we’ll give this more thought! 📈
Slack,1,0,@noahmp @TimHaines 🤗 Thanks Tim, and yes Noah! You should see the option when you long tap a message. 👇⏲
Slack,0,0,@theonetruebix Gotcha, it looks like you've found a bug! 🙈 We've passed this on to our engineers to look into a fix. Thanks for reporting!
Slack,0,0,@theonetruebix That's strange! Are you uploading a file directly from the app or sharing into it?
Slack,1,0,@adamnash 😽💕
Slack,0,0,@theonetruebix That would usually mean it was uploaded and shared into a private channel or DM — are you seeing something else?
Slack,0,0,@mangicrypto A bot or app is definitely the way to go! Check out https://t.co/jdxvxrh7IQ. 🤖✨
Slack,0,0,@LearningBill Yikes! Could you send a note to https://t.co/WeWXcwsZIU with a few more details? We'll sort that out. 💫
Slack,0,0,@ahs2oz (2/2) ...but you should still see an option to "open this link in your browser" while being redirected to the desktop app. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@ahs2oz Ah! That was part of a recent change to deprecate our archive pages... (1/2)
Slack,0,0,@WillowPolson Thanks for the feedback and sorry it was a bit of a runaround to figure that out! We'll look into making this clearer. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@halifaxbeard That doesn't sound right! Could you drop some additional info to https://t.co/WeWXcwsZIU? We'll take a closer look.
Slack,0,0,@_spyder 🤔 Odd! It could be a number of things — mind sending some details to https://t.co/WeWXcwsZIU?

Slack,1,0,@mdkail Got it! Our support team will take it from here. Thanks again for sharing! 🙇
Slack,1,0,@szechuan Ah, gotcha. Thanks! Would you mind writing in so we can dig deeper? You can drop us a note using /feedback in Slack!
Slack,0,0,@ahs2oz Oh, strange! So nothing happens when you click the timestamp? Or when you share an archive link the timestamp isn't hyperlinked?
Slack,0,0,@mdkail Please do! You can drop us a note at feedback@slack.com if you'd like to share in greater detail.
Slack,0,0,@mdkail And what reasonable advice it is! We'll share this with our product team. Please keep the feedback coming! 💌🏃
Slack,0,0,@twofifty6 Oh, how odd. Would you mind writing to us at feedback@slack.com so we can take a closer look? 🔍👀
Slack,2,0,@leeflower @jer_ Hmm, the plot thickens! Sure, please drop us a note so we can investigate.
Slack,1,0,@chadsipes Something along the lines of — "/remind @joe you have a 9am meeting, at 7:45AM tomorrow" — should do the trick!
Slack,0,0,@leeflower @jer_ Alas, we might have to dig deeper. 😔 Could you please drop us a note? We'll take a closer look. feedback@slack.com 🕵️
Slack,0,0,@szechuan Hmm, that's an odd one. Sorry, Sacha! Do you see any error messages?
Slack,0,0,@oquendo_joel The app icon? It just felt like time for a little update! A change is as good as a holiday, right? 🤔🏝
Slack,0,0,@GregLescoe Why, hello, beta friend! 🙌 Drop us a note here and we'll see what we can do: feedback@slack.com 💌💃
Slack,0,0,@pityonline Our pleasure! 🤗
Slack,1,0,@GregLescoe If you don't mind adding another beta to the mix, would you like to try ours? https://t.co/bYSl3bJ2hl 🤞
Slack,0,0,@GregLescoe Yep, that sounds like a bug we're working on, sorry! We may have fix for it, though.
Slack,0,0,@GregLescoe Oh boy, sorry for the unhelpful little rectangles! 🙈😔 What version of Slack are you using?
Slack,0,0,@twofifty6 Sorry for the hassles! Hmm, any chance Slack might still be active on the desktop app during those 30 minutes? 🕵️📱
Slack,1,0,@CryptOptimus Thank you for sharing your ideas with us, we really appreciate it.
Slack,3,0,@noopkat Adorable! 😍🍔
Slack,0,0,@pityonline There's a few! Take a peek here: https://t.co/fTC6b33VMg

Slack,0,0,@pityonline Sorry, friend! These app names are simply examples. They aren't representative of any apps in the directory. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@PJCavan Ah, apologies for the trouble! If you're having issues signing in, please drop us a note: feedback@slack.com. 💌 We're here to help.
Slack,1,0,@dubstrike Not just yet, we're afraid! Though we'll certainly let the team know you found it handy. 😉
Slack,1,0,@keeganoshi Not as yet, but it'd be a handy option to have! Thanks for sharing, we'll pass the idea through to the team. 🎥
Slack,5,0,@grlalx Phew, we're so pleased! 😘🥂
Slack,1,0,@leeflower @jer_ Gah, we're sorry to hear that! Another thing that might work is pressing shift + esc from the desktop app. 🤞
Slack,1,0,@dubstrike As for the team icon thing, it sounds like it might have been a change we were testing. We're glad you liked it, though! 😅
Slack,0,0,@samcarow 🌟🌟 NO U! 🌟🌟
Slack,1,0,@dubstrike We're glad the beta's feeling snappier! The square unread indicator is a known bug, we're working on it. 🐛🔨
Slack,1,0,@samcarow ADD MORE STARS. LIKE **THIS**.
Slack,4,1,@YourProtagonist Enh. It's okay.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Slack,2,0,@grlalx Oh, oh! Okay, how about trying "/giphy rose wine" – that should generate some more suitable responses. 😉
Slack,1,0,@laurenrabaino Hmm, all seems OK on our end! 🤔 Can you try "Help" > "Clear cache and restart" and see whether things start working again?
Slack,0,0,@tjohnell No plans just yet, but it's certainly something we can consider! We'll pass your wishes along to the team. 🙇
Slack,1,0,@leeflower @jer_ That's a great start! If the cache clear doesn't seem to help just give us a shout. 📢
Slack,1,0,@kapowaz Thanks, friend! We'll get to it as soon as we can. 😄
Slack,0,0,@metamatt Glad to hear it's working again. 🤠
Slack,1,0,@laceynwilliams Sorry for any weirdness, Lacey! 😔
Slack,0,0,@jer_ @leeflower Do you want some troubleshooting assistance, folks? 🙏
Slack,6,0,@grlalx Try it without the accent. There are some rosé gifs when we try it that way! But you might also get a rose. Which is also nice. 😐 🌹
Slack,0,0,@kara_woo @leeflower 😓 What type of ghost notifications? Pop-over notifications, or numbered badges with no actual mention/keyword? 👻
Slack,0,0,@kapowaz Hey, Ben. Sorry for the troubles. Could you write into feedback@slack.com? We'll respond and help you out ASAP. 😄
Slack,0,0,@metamatt Oh no! We had a bug on this, but it's fixed in our latest version, 2.6.3. Which version of the macOS desktop app are you using?

Slack,0,0,@GeruuReyes Good grief. Could you kindly drop us a note at feedback@slack.com? We'd like to take a look under the hood! 🚙🛠
Slack,1,0,@kgardnr No plans right now but if you’d like to discuss in more detail you can write in to feedback@slack.com and we'd be happy to listen!
Slack,1,0,@mcdev Perhaps you could have a keyword word that these guests add to their notifications, which you use when they're needed.
Slack,0,0,@jrearick Really sorry. 🙏 We're working to address this. If you see it spike, please write in (feedback@slack.com) so we can take a look.
Slack,0,0,@mcdev You cannot add guests to User Groups. We restrict this since they don't have full access to all the channels on your team.
Slack,1,0,@echosa Ah, we see what you mean. Sorry for the confusion! We'll pass this along for a further look. 🔍👀
Slack,1,0,@jessejanderson We're working on updating Slack's emojis to the latest unicode set, so no clown by default at the moment, sadly. 🤡🤠👩‍🚀
Slack,0,0,@sleuth  The closest thing is the "Show Activity" `@` button in the top right, to see mentions, reactions, etc. Not quite what you want. 😞
Slack,0,0,@sleuth Aaah, thanks for that clarification. We don't have anything like that right now, but it's good idea we'll pass along! 🙌
Slack,0,0,@GeruuReyes Hmm? If you @-mention the bot by its username (@-srraqueta) does it respond or become active?

Slack,2,0,@MrSebguer @sarahleeyoga Sorry about this, it's a bug we're working on! Can you please Cmnd/Ctrl + r and see if that helps?
Slack,1,0,@basche42  Thanks for letting us know you'd like this! 🌻
Slack,0,0,@corinneduyvis Sadly the text box itself is not re-sizable, maybe try our zoom function in the desktop app?  `Preferences > Accessibility`
Slack,0,0,@gavpret Oh no! Could you write in so we can get some details? feedback@slack.com
Slack,0,0,@bangasho We have a long list! We take lots of feedback like yours into account. We can't promise anything but we do our best!

Slack,0,0,@bangasho We understand! We don't have this on our road map right now, but the team does know and we will take things into consideration.
Slack,1,0,@adammckerlie Ah, that option is so restricted because it can't be undone. Loosening that up a bit is something we could consider, though! 🔐
Slack,0,0,@bangasho Yes – we've shared it with our team. Thank you for the suggestion. Please let us know if you have any other ideas! 🙌
Slack,0,0,@mehedih_ Oh, but if you click the banner or plus sign, you'll get the option to add some, just like if you had zero Direct Messages open! ➕
Slack,2,0,@edyesed Yes! Open the thread in question up, hover over the top message, click the "…" option, and then "Unfollow thread". You're saved! 🎉
Slack,0,0,@1e4_ We did! Hopefully it makes it a little easier for you to keep track of your team's apps. 🎉✨

Slack,0,0,@marcovanheerde Thanks for crying that first! Can you please go to Help > Clear Cache and Restart and let us know if that resolves things?
Slack,0,0,@marcovanheerde Ooops, doesn't look good! Can you try hitting cmd + R to see if that clears things up for you here? Thanks!

Slack,0,0,@cinematicme Sorry about that! There is an underlying bug at work here. This is high on our priority list to fix 🙌
Slack,0,0,@curtkrone Gotcha. This is occurring on the latest iOS app version too? Does going to Settings > Advanced > 'Reset Cache' help at all?
Slack,0,0,@Mr_Sanghvi That's not good at all. So sorry, Yash, but we promise that it's being looked at. We'll let you know when this is patched up! 🔧
Slack,0,0,@curtkrone We do have a long way to go. ❤️ Any specific things that you'd like to see in our iOS app that we can take note of?
Slack,0,0,@Mr_Sanghvi ... then press 'Share Message' > 'Share in...', do you see more direct message options? 🤞
Slack,0,0,@Mr_Sanghvi  (1/2) Oh no, so we've found a known bug for this. If you long press the general area of this message (and not the actual link)
Slack,0,0,@Mr_Sanghvi Gotcha — that definitely helps! Might be a long shot, but are there anymore DMs hiding underneath if you scroll down?
Slack,0,0,@Mr_Sanghvi ...information! 🕵🏻‍♀️ 2/2
Slack,0,0,@Mr_Sanghvi Huh, that's interesting! When you mention sharing links, is this sharing URL links in a DM? We might need more... 1/2

Slack,0,0,@DBofficial Oh, it's likely we can explain this better at feedback@slack.com. Mind writing in there?
Slack,0,0,@shai_wininger About the first and last name, not sure we understand! Mind explaining cases where a member's last name is appearing first?
Slack,0,0,@heathborders Yikes, we're sorry! Can you please try using shift + esc from the desktop app to see whether that might clear them? 🙏
Slack,1,0,@shai_wininger 😱 Firstly, what are you seeing (or not seeing) in regards to search on the iOS app?
Slack,2,0,@robn @voxkev Yep, we can help! If you write us at feedback@slack.com we'll be glad to lend a hand. 🙇
Slack,1,0,@deim0s13 Ooh, mind telling us more about your use case through feedback@slack.com? It'll be easier to explain and we may have thoughts!
Slack,0,0,@_dirtypuppet Yikes, sorry friend! This looks related to an existing bug — is it happening on the Windows app, by any chance?

Slack,0,0,@natetharp In that case please write to feedback@slack.com with the team details and we'll take a look.
Slack,0,0,@electricarchaeo When did you delete the messages? The team statistics update once a day.
Slack,0,0,@natetharp Hmm, are you a single-channel or multi-channel guest?
Slack,0,0,@janephilipps Oh that certainly doesn't look right. Thanks for letting us know. We're looking into it now.
Slack,0,0,@Hinchable By shortcuts do you mean text substitutions? Or something else?

Slack,1,0,@cmgurley Ah, sorry for the troubles. That sounds like a bug we're investigating. 🔍👀
Slack,0,0,@RyanWoodDFW No, those don't count in terms of storage space.
Slack,0,0,@tlg5208 We're working on it, but no ETA to share at the moment. In the meantime, links unfurl, so pasting an image URL will work for now. ✌
Slack,0,0,@ndrewmcknight We don't currently have a Search filter to exclude–if, but we'll let the team know you'd be a fan of such a feature.

Slack,0,0,@MadeByEW Thank you kindly!
Slack,0,0,@GenuineJack The LOG (Lack of GIF) Blues are real, and are best combatted by at least three cute animal gifs. Emoji help, too. 🐶🐱🐭🐼🐨🐣

Slack,0,0,@ndrewmcknight Interesting! Not something we've thought of, but we'll pass this along to the team. 🤓
Slack,0,0,@Nomaanism That depends on your company's compliance rules and specific retention policies— we recommend asking a team Admin about this. 🙊
Slack,0,0,@beekay__ All of our archives are now accessible in the app. 🙃
Slack,1,0,@bulgarianjer Our twitter integration (https://t.co/SSDRKrdb9a) will only auto-post public tweets right now. 🙊

Slack,0,0,@ehrlicp Nice idea! We'll pass it along. ⭐️ For now, do regular stars, "mark as unread", and reminders help?

Slack,0,0,@amjadali_01 No plans to bring it back right now, but thanks for the feedback!

Slack,1,0,@altcoinio If it helps, you can use "my" instead of "<teamName>" to share links — it'll redirect to a user's own team if they're signed in.

Slack,1,0,@mikaoioi A dark theme is something we're exploring as we speak… 🌛🕶
Slack,0,0,@mattbrailsford Sorry about that. Desktop? If you catch up on your reading, does pressing Shift Escape to mark the team as read solve this?
Slack,0,0,@aexmo Sorry about that! Is this in any particular app?
Slack,0,0,@kevinresol Understood — thanks ever so much for the feedback 🙇🔘🔨
Slack,0,0,@aeris_mel There's no published list or anything like that, sorry 🙌

Slack,0,0,@niallsmart Hmm, after a polite conversation with your team? 🙊😹💝
Slack,0,0,@bdarfler Ah, so sorry, Ben — this sounds like one of our known issues. Does clearing all unreads on desktop with Shift+Esc help at all?
Slack,0,0,@joeflateau 🤛🏼
Slack,0,0,@joeflateau Thanks for understanding! ✨
Slack,0,0,@joeflateau 'Background activity' means that Slack updates channels, checks for notifications, etc. for a short time after exiting the app.

Slack,2,0,@cherise_ch Hey Cherise! Sorry about this — if it's part of the new emoji set, we're still working on getting them on our desktop apps. 💔
Slack,0,0,@XpriNS Huh, that'd be neat! Similar to how new messages are highlighted in the 'All Threads' view?
Slack,1,0,@pnwthomas Got it! We can definitely see what you mean. We'll talk about it with the team some more. Thank you again! 💖
Slack,0,0,@XpriNS Ooh, that's an idea! Where in the channel would you suggest they go to be most effective for this? 🤔
Slack,0,0,@pnwthomas Is your team currently using DND to avoid pings in the late hours? We find that's a handy way to prevent those, too!

Slack,1,0,@codetheory Ah! We're glad to hear it's sorted out for you! If more strangeness crops up, definitely let us know! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@codetheory Hmm, could the notification be for a message in a different team you're signed into on mobile?
Slack,7,0,@kentbrew But DAAAAD! (Sorry, we couldn't help it.)
Slack,1,0,@coryborg 🐔🦋🐖😍
Slack,1,0,@uNcleargamer @TaehyunLim Yes! With our latest release you can toggle off message previews in Notifications on iOS to keep those hidden. ✨
Slack,0,0,@ramblingjane Hmmm... 🤔 Can you please try the same scenario, but this time use Cmd+1 and let us know if that brings the app back?
Slack,1,0,@alpennec Good eye! We're working on getting those sorted out, thanks for bearing with us! ❤️
Slack,35,15,At this Japanese mobile games company, teams work transparently, honestly, respectfully, and fearlessly—using Slack. https://t.co/bKLxqZa5VY
Slack,1,0,@_minikori Will do! 👋
*books flights to all Slack offices* ✈️
*spends next month traveling around the world, high fiveing * 🙏
*loves job* 😍
Slack,1,0,@cryoshon Thanks for letting us now you'd like to see it! We're considering ways forward.
Slack,0,0,@ashrafrahal Oh no! Could you please try resetting your cache and let us know if that helps? feedback@slack.com if you'd like to write in.
Slack,0,0,@jasonkarns ...feedback@slack.com 2/2
Slack,0,0,@jasonkarns Ah, we see. SSO should work straight from the app. If you are having trouble with LastPass/SSO, could you drop us a line?... 1/2
Slack,0,0,@MissBriSparkles Got it. We're taking a look now— should be back in touch with you very soon. Thanks for your patience! 🙌
Slack,0,0,@ashrafrahal Oh, no! 😰 What seems to be the problem?
Slack,0,0,@iMartyn Sorry about this! You found the workaround for the bug in this scenario. We're working on a fix, and appreciate your patience!
Slack,0,0,@jasonkarns Sorry, perhaps we've misunderstood. Are you unable to sign into the app at all? We suggested that flow for LastPass access.
Slack,0,0,@realbenfeldman Oh that doesn't sound good. Would you please write to feedback@slack.com so our iOS team can take a look?
Slack,0,0,@jasonkarns That will launch the app and sign you in there automatically. 2/2
Slack,0,0,@jasonkarns If you'd like, you can sign in with a browser and then choose "Open the Slack app" from the team menu. 1/2
Slack,0,0,@MiaAlanisPR We aren't seeing any issues with Posts. Could you please write to feedback@slack.com so we can take a closer look?
Slack,2,0,@mor10 Sorry! That definitely would make threads better. It's something we're exploring, so keep an eye out in the updates! 🙇 🙌
Slack,0,0,@moday77 There's no built in way at the moment, but you might have luck searching in the App Directory (https://t.co/nKkSzXWiV3) or Zapier!
Slack,0,0,@ramblingjane Oh no! Is it that you closed the app to the dock and you're looking for a shortcut to bring it back up into focus?
Slack,0,0,@gschueler You mean something different than the current process for uploading images? 🤔
Slack,0,0,@Iron_Sean That does sound weird! Please get in touch at feedback@slack.com and our Windows team will take a look.
Slack,1,0,@_minikori Thank you! We'll let the iOS team know about this.
Slack,0,0,@Tavarin That's no good. Would you please write to feedback@slack.com so our Android team can look into it?
Slack,0,0,@_minikori By, um, poop do you mean the app crashed? Or something else happened?
Slack,0,0,@__korpikopan__ We hear you. We're trying to make it better all the time.
Slack,0,0,@jesutherl Sorry about that. Please go into the main app menu and choose Help >  Clear Cache and Restart. Are things better after that?
Slack,1,0,@EssentiallyEric Hey there! It's something we're exploring though there's no way to enable that just yet. We'll pass the request along! 👨‍💻🍎
Slack,0,0,@maslowbeer That is unexpected. Could you please write to feedback@slack.com so we can get more details and investigate?
Slack,0,0,@PRKSpeaks That definitely could be handy! We'll pass the idea along. 🙌
Slack,0,0,@ShawnChittle Very odd! Would you mind writing in to feedback@slack.com for more detailed troubleshooting to figure out what's going wrong?
Slack,0,0,@ADAMATOMIC If you send a message in those channels does the badge go away?
Slack,0,0,@zachychan6 @willyhakim Right back at ya! 💘
Slack,0,0,@Iron_Sean Yes! In our desktop apps you’ll appear active when Slack's open and you're interacting with the computer. https://t.co/VjbuxOyvee
Slack,0,0,@jamesleebennett You could see if there's an app for that already: https://t.co/de6aPqPzkH 🎶  "Currently listening to: Rick Astley" 🎶
Slack,0,0,@jereswinnen In that case please write to feedback@slack.com. Our iOS team will look into this.
Slack,0,0,@KBIA_engineer The files page (https://t.co/w8ppVX9EC2) is one at a time, but you could try our API (https://t.co/0qoO35JOJ2) to go faster.
Slack,0,0,@AndraZaharia Oh no! Are these Slack desktop notifications for new messages in the app, or something else?
Slack,0,0,@MissBriSparkles Oh no. We're happy to check for you. 👀 Would you mind letting us know the name it came in under so we can search?
Slack,0,0,@willyhakim @zachychan6 If neither of those work, please write in to feedback@slack.com to investigate deeper because this is perplexing! 🤔
Slack,0,0,@zachychan6 @willyhakim Try clearing your app's local storage (Settings > Advanced > Reset local storage), or logging out of that team.
Slack,0,0,@cra We'd love to know more about what's wrong with it, so we can see about making improvements. 🙏
Slack,1,0,@brooksied Interesting! We'll think about it. Meantime, our Do Not Disturb feature should help (they'll see the message when they sign in).
Slack,0,0,@oliverfoggin We're terribly sorry. Are you signed into more than one team? If there's any you can afford to sign out of, we'd suggest that.
Slack,1,0,@UXfinley We're so glad to hear that! 😊
Slack,1,0,@hersh_amin If you're the primary owner, you can do so at https://t.co/hWVpGv5soL. 🔃
Slack,0,0,@jonnyzzz Oh no! So sorry. Were these regular messages or file uploads? When 4G returned, the message was still there but wouldn't send?
Slack,1,0,@HarrisonWeber We're sorry to say you can't. 😓
Slack,0,0,@iMartyn Hmm. If you read your most important messages, then hit shift-esc, does that help? (It should mark everything as read)
Slack,0,0,@briandsaunders @AmeliaEasten 🙃 😩 So sorry, and thanks for following up. Are images being uploaded through mobile, desktop app or browser?
Slack,0,0,@ArthurMingard Yay! We'll pass your idea along! 💡 Best way to catch up on mentions now is the Activity feed. (clicking `@` in the top right)
Slack,1,0,@rsiegel Aha, understood. We'll see what we can think up over here. 💭
Slack,1,0,@alpennec You make a good point; we'll share that with the Calls team. Thank you. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@_Woodgie You can always pick up a pair at https://t.co/qpyV08GSGc. And profits go to charity! 😅
Slack,0,0,@rsiegel You can share a message to a different channel and direct folks to continue the conversation there. Would that help?
Slack,0,0,@jereswinnen Hm. Are you by any chance active on the desktop app at the same time? Because we won't ping your phone if so. 📢
Slack,1,0,@oi_andrew Yep. You can allow signups from specific email domains at https://t.co/YPuK7R34ca, then they sign up at [team].slack.com/signup.
Slack,0,0,@eoghancunneen That's a very nifty idea — thank you! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@hjbme Ah yes, so sorry!
Slack,0,0,@jordbrauer We're gathering feedback on this, no set plans right now!
Slack,1,0,@AkiiZedd Happy to hear you got sorted in the end!
Slack,1,0,@ChrisChinch drop an email into pr@slack.com please! 🙌
Slack,0,0,@JofArnold 🦋🙏😊
Slack,1,1,@JofArnold Oh, well, there are block quotes for larger chunks of text using >>> at the start!
Slack,1,0,@jmwagner 🙌💖✨
Slack,3,0,@jmwagner Oof, that's annoying, sorry! If you swipe right to left, and select Settings > Advanced > Reset Cache this should clear the file.
Slack,0,0,@LewisTheobald Oh no, is this happening for your whole team? If you write in to feedback@slack.com we'll investigate! 🔎
Slack,0,0,@DionSegijn Hmm. 🤔 If you don't mind dropping us a line to feedback@slack.com we'll happily take a closer look!
Slack,0,0,@pennymerelle We beelieve in you. 🐝🙌💖
Slack,0,0,@BMatB 🤔 That's a strange one! Could you provide some details as to where you're seeing the emojis in emoji codes only?
Slack,0,0,@jmwagner Sorry–we meant have you tried to upload the picture from the mobile or desktop apps? Could you let us know which one?
Slack,0,0,@himayyay Thanks for the feedback! We're looking into making message formatting more straightforward for the future. 🙇
Slack,1,0,@jmwagner Sorry for the trouble! On which app did you try to upload the picture?
Slack,0,0,@sowasred2012 Sorry for the trouble! Our team will be able to help further at feedback@slack.com 🙏
Slack,0,0,@DionSegijn Sorry for the trouble! Are you trying to edit a message right after you sent it?
Slack,1,0,@efemoney_ Afraid not, sorry! But we'll share your feedback about the Compact theme to our product team. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@dteam69 Would you mind sending us a report at feedback@slack.com? Our team will take a closer look at why this is happening. 🙌
Slack,0,0,@alexhanschke Hope you had a good game! ⚽️🙌
Slack,0,0,@pmberry2007 Yes, that's true. 😞 Sorry for the hassle, Paul. Our team is aware and hopefully improvements should be made in the future. 🙌
Slack,0,0,@Gtdgeoff That's what we meant, sorry for the confusion! 🙏
Slack,0,0,@Gtdgeoff Sorry–we meant swipe from right to left, then scroll down to Settings and select the Sign out option.
Slack,0,0,@pmberry2007 We do! Your machine's language and keyboard settings will need to be set to English UK.
Slack,0,0,@dteam69 Is this happening on desktop or mobile?
Slack,0,0,@Gtdgeoff In a channel in that team, swipe left, then tap Settings, and scroll down for the Sign Out option 👍
Slack,0,0,@dteam69 Eep! What seems to be the trouble, sorry?
Slack,0,0,@ndrewbiddle 📝👍
Slack,0,0,@ndrewbiddle That's right — sorry about that. We'll note this as a feature request, though 🙌
Slack,1,0,@FahadKB Thank you for using Slack! We really appreciate it 💖
Slack,0,0,@joachim_d Thanks — we're so sorry for the hassle 🙌
Slack,0,0,@odtorson The Twitter app can also pull tweets from an account into a channel. We're following Twitter's TOS by asking for these permissions
Slack,0,0,@philandstuff Sorry for the frustration! We'll note for the team that this is something you'd like 🙇
Slack,0,0,@ndrewbiddle No OCR functionality, sorry, but Slack will index text-based PDFs 👍
Slack,0,0,@argen Please do let us know if not: https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,0,0,@argen Sorry about that! Does swiping left and tapping Settings > Advanced > Reset Cache help at all?
Slack,0,0,@joachim_d If that doesn't help, please drop us a line: https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,0,0,@joachim_d Oh no! Could you try swiping left from a channel and going to Settings > Advanced > Reset Cache 🙏
Slack,0,0,@femkesvs Thanks, friend! We'll get to it as soon as we can. 🏃
Slack,1,0,@_schristo Thanks for sharing! It could be a nice option for those who'd prefer to consume threads in-channel. We'll give it some thought! 🙌
Slack,0,0,@wcp285601662 This isn't something we can really give advice on. Our apologies! 🙇
Slack,1,0,@shakedog You can enable “approved apps”, and then restrict which apps can be installed. More info here: https://t.co/INbsOozeWu. 🙌
Slack,0,0,@Copons Well shucks! That's good to hear. 😊
Slack,0,0,@SeanLagged That's completely frustrating, sorry. 😔 It's something we want to support, and it's on our radar. Though no firm plans yet.
Slack,0,0,@ChiSenires Thanks for your kind words and your patience! 😊💖
Slack,0,0,@mikeknep Afraid so. 😔 You'll need to change the notification settings by clicking the gear cog icon in each group DM.
Slack,1,0,@pixelplotters Yep, gotcha! We'll make sure to pass this on to the team to consider further. Thanks for sharing. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@iAmirhasan Sorry for the hassle. 😔 Could you send us your logs from the Help menu under "Show Logs in Explorer" to feedback@slack.com? 🙇
Slack,1,0,@ChiSenires Argh, sorry for the hassle. 😔 It's definitely on our radar, and we'd love to support it. Though no concrete plans currently.
Slack,0,1,@hhariri Nothing to that extent. For more information: https://t.co/5UKOSFQe4l. We’re at feedback@slack.com if you have other questions!
Slack,1,0,@_ty13r There is no way to disable reminders from team members at the moment, but we'll share this feature request with the team.
Slack,0,0,@circulargenius You do you, Josh. 🤗 We're pleased to be of service!
Slack,0,0,@jonnyzzz We only push notifications after a period of inactivity on the desktop app. Would this explain why those two didn't come through?
Slack,0,0,@Copons We're sorry that it's not your cup of tea. Hopefully it will grow on you! 🌱🌿🌳
Slack,0,0,@saaiko 😘💅
Slack,0,0,@zachychan6 @willyhakim Good grief! Sorry, Zach. Does refreshing with Cmd/Ctrl + R stop it? ☎️⏰
Slack,0,0,@suhinini Thank you! We'll keep our eyes peeled. 👀🔎
Slack,0,0,@lucasmitchell Jeepers, we're so sorry, Lucas. 😢🚧 Would you mind writing in so we can take a closer look, please? https://t.co/WeWXcwsZIU
Slack,0,0,@persturesson Yay! Well done, super sleuth! 🎩🔎⭐️
Slack,1,0,@wintersweet Holy moly, that's a lot of emoji! 😂 Wild! 🐇🐁🐓
Slack,1,0,@femkesvs Hmm, could you please write in so we can take a closer look? https://t.co/WeWXcwsZIU 🕵️💌
Slack,1,0,@DigitalJazz You have exceptional taste, friend! Baking and maths, what a wonderful combination. 👌🍰🔢
Slack,0,0,@mHiSaN Ah, sorry. It sounds like you've run into a bug that we're currently investigating. 😞 What version of Slack do you have installed?
Slack,0,0,@argen Oh no, sorry! 😔 Do you find uploads fail on both wifi and mobile connections?
Slack,0,0,@ZeroDistraction Yikes, sorry! 🙀 How are they broken — missing settings or delayed messages? What version of Slack is installed? 🔍
Slack,0,0,@aoberoi @WadeWegner @ashevat @matvelloso 👋 Our pals at @SlackAPI might have some tips. 📚
Slack,1,1,@trionkidnapper @jen20 We do not look at or sell content to advertisers — it's just not in our business. 🙇👍
Slack,2,0,@DigitalJazz We see what you mean. 😐 We hope you'll learn to love the new, non-square icon! ✌️🐿
Slack,1,0,@ShawnHooper That's a great idea! We'll pass that on for further consideration. 📝🐕
Slack,0,0,@Tmonty1132 It would be great to offer this. Sadly, push notifications can only use your mobile's built-in options. We hope this may change✨
Slack,1,0,@securisec Absolutely, we'd be glad to pass that feature request along to the team! ✍️
Slack,0,0,@lucasmitchell We're sorry to hear that! Is there anything we can help with, or do you have any feedback for us? 📱
Slack,0,0,@securisec Posting permissions can be limited on the #general channel! More here: https://t.co/4BBFVkLKTA 🎒🐩
Slack,0,0,@ShawnChittle That's odd! Are you able to play other videos uploaded on desktop on your iOS? What happens if you switch networks? 🤔
Slack,1,1,@dgrandhay We're sorry you aren't loving the new icon! We hope it'll grow on you! 🌷
Slack,0,0,@suhinini That sounds odd - no changes on our end with emoji autocomplete. Can you write in to feedback@slack.com with some details? 📝🤔
Slack,0,0,@NugentCantileno 👋Hi there! We're sorry for the trouble. Only the channel creator and team owners/admins can rename it. Could that be why? 🤔
Slack,0,0,@ranachora108 Perhaps — group calls are available on Slack to paid teams: https://t.co/N42fbeCTKS.
Slack,1,0,@TumbaSherman It's not you, it's us. But once you begin typing, suggested channel matches will appear!
Slack,0,0,@theyonibomber Thanks for writing in — one of our specialists will get back to you asap.
Slack,1,0,@Wandelstock  Sometimes a little change doesn't hurt 😉
Slack,0,0,@daniel4hire  We recently retire the archive pages in Slack. We'll let the team know you'd like to see this reintroduced! 👌
Slack,1,0,@yoav85  Sorry for the trouble. Can you drop us a line at feedback@slack.com. We'd like to dig deeper for you. 🙏
Slack,0,0,@iTiamo  You're not alone in this one! We’re exploring this idea, so stay tuned.😃
Slack,0,0,@WadeWegner  We're happy to dig into this further for you! Please drop us a line feedback@slack.com
Slack,3,0,@Chesley @eli_schiff  Good eye! 🔎
Slack,10,1,@eli_schiff  Good eye! 🔍
Slack,1,0,@kubukoz  Sorry you feel that way! We'll let the team know that a square icon is an option you'd like to have.
Slack,1,0,@stephenhersee  Oh you know...magic and stuff. Thanks for ordering with us! 💥
Slack,1,0,@itsrichspicer Our security team is monitoring this situation & working  to find the best solution. Thank you for your patience!
Slack,1,0,@BOGA32_  We did get a little makeover! 💇
Slack,2,0,@botlistco   😉
Slack,0,0,@benjamin_payne Sorry for the shock! 😨
Slack,0,0,@osyoyu Sorry about the trouble. Deleting and reinstalling the app should help!
Slack,0,0,@WReynoldsYoung Yes, we are actively tracking this as a bug!
Slack,0,0,@WReynoldsYoung  We’re so sorry for the trouble. Our team is working to resolve this ASAP.
We're looking into this as we speak.
Slack,0,0,@samclarke 💗
Slack,0,0,@Mackolicious12  We sure do! Check out our London openings 👉 https://t.co/UzXwhFXn7i
Slack,1,0,@sajid9185  We're trying our hardest, but there's always room for improvement. We'll pass your feedback along!
Slack,0,0,@bhavinhjoshi Hmmm. Would you mind writing into us at feedback@slack.com? We'd like to take a deeper look for you. 🙏
Slack,0,0,@lexiatwork  😢
Slack,0,1,@ryanvarick We did! Gave it a lick of paint for summer. ☀️
Slack,0,0,@femkesvs If you press shift+esc, does that clear it? 🤔
Slack,0,0,@smad 🤔 That is true!
Slack,0,0,@woongy Single channel guests can only see the other members of the channel they're in. Hope that helps!
Slack,0,0,@Grossiaux Sorry! We'd recommend turning off notifications fully while you're away but a longer snooze might be good — we'll think on it!
Slack,0,0,@riking27 Drop a note to feedback@slack.com, we can help you there!
Slack,0,0,@Bl1zz You'll need an admin to remove a bot — can you write in to feedback@slack.com so we can help further?
Slack,0,0,@persturesson Ah yes, sorry for the frustration there! It's not possible to turn it off but we'll certainly pass that along to the team.
Slack,0,0,@skippedrecord No plans to change it back but we're listening to all feedback — thank you. 🙇
Slack,2,0,@xavierverdaguer 🤗
Slack,0,0,@thirdmandesign That's a nifty idea — thank you for sharing! We'll pass that on to the team. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@malonehedges We don't generally but if you can drop a note to feedback@slack.com, we'll reply as speedily as possible!
Slack,1,0,@_MattWelch_ We hope you had a great vacation! 😎
Slack,1,0,@joshicsin Thank you so much for the kind words! 💖
Slack,0,0,@gioismeyo Have you tried cmd/ctrl-[? Should do the trick! Along with cmd/ctrl-] to go forward.
Slack,0,0,@tatianatmac You can't, we're sorry to say. But we'll make a note of the idea. 📝
Slack,0,0,@farhanmohamed Ooh. Ok, that is strange. Do you mind dropping a note to feedback@slack.com so we can investigate further?
Slack,0,0,@NorthIsUp 🤐
Slack,0,0,@kjowong @SlackAPI 🙌
Slack,0,0,@GandalfsBaby Ah, we see what you mean. We'll share this with the team. Thanks!
Slack,0,0,@George_Kourdin Interesting idea 💡 We'll give this some thought, thank you!
Slack,0,0,@roisiproven Ah that's good to note. If you run into anything similar, please let us know. We'll keep an eye out! 👀
Slack,0,0,@dracos Excellent, thank you! Our team will be in touch soon to help sort this out. 🙏
Slack,0,0,@Bl1zz Hmm, was it Slackbot, or a different bot?
Slack,1,0,@plasticjinks Oh goodness, even with our typos! We meant to say "sorry to hear you're not a fan". Is it the weekend yet? 👀  PS- 💖  you, too!
Slack,0,0,@dracos Thanks— it definitely seems buggy. Could you send us your logs from the Help menu under "Show Logs in Finder" to feedback@slack.com
Slack,0,0,@JamesByrness Sorry to hear! Maybe next time 💫
Slack,0,0,@roisiproven Hmm, which version of the Slack app is it? Version 3.23 is our most recent one, and we haven't been able to reproduce this yet.
Slack,0,0,@plasticjinks We're sorry to hear it's not a fan of the new icon 😔  We appreciate the feedback!
Slack,0,0,@BrianWeaverOS You can do that with the #general channel! https://t.co/HuJF4TVdQO
Slack,0,0,@dracos How strange! Can we ask which version of the app you're on? You can check the number under Slack > About Slack in the MacOS menubar.
Slack,0,0,@memorie_holiday Well, we still think you're delightful. 💕
Slack,1,0,@ln_parker Thanks so much! Great thought— we'll see what we can do. 💡
Slack,1,0,@morid1n We're so sorry this has been so awful. We are trying to figure it out and wondered if you could write us at feedback@slack.com? 🙇
Slack,1,0,@tracypholmes We're feeling pretty good! We're taking turns with the weekend so we all get a chance to go enjoy. Thanks for thinking of us!
Slack,52,0,@mathowie >Get back to work.
Slack,0,0,@BrianWeaverOS Hmm that's not right! Could you drop us a line at feedback@slack.com so we can take a closer look? 🙏
Slack,63,23,If you're

Slack,1,0,@its_brookebell Anytime! Have a lovely time! 🎉☀️
Slack,1,0,@its_brookebell We did make a few small adjustments to align it with our other app icons! Sorry for the feelings of strangeness. ✨
Slack,0,0,@JosephRooks Hmm, could you try clearing the app's cache from the Help menu in the MacOS menu bar to see if that helps? We have a hunch.
Slack,0,0,@simplifyclarify We're really sorry to hear this. Can you share more about any specific issues you're running into that we can troubleshoot?
Slack,0,0,@megaroeny Mostly we've updated our icons across all our platforms for consistency 👍
Slack,0,0,@JosephRooks That is very odd! Is this behavior happening with any other menus, or only this one? Are you using an external mouse?
Slack,0,0,@JosephRooks Hmm, which dropdown would that be (what are you trying to change)? And which platform is this happening on?
Slack,0,0,@j_wolfyy We're delighted to hear that you think so! Thank you! ❤️
Slack,1,0,@RohitAlexander Why would we do that? @slack is a wonderful person.
Slack,0,0,@martinb3 @-here is limited to only those who are online right now. So the two options intentionally behave differently. 2/2
Slack,0,0,@martinb3 User groups are intended to notify everyone in the specific group regardless of whether they are currently online or not. 1/2
Slack,1,0,@megaroeny We've given the icon a little nip, tuck and cleaning up.
Slack,0,0,@martinb3 Are you getting these mentions when you've enabled Do Not Disturb? 2/2
Slack,0,0,@martinb3 User group mentions and @-mentions work the same way. So you shouldn't be getting one when you aren't getting the other. 1/2
Slack,0,0,@rcauvin We recently updated our iOS and Android icons.
Slack,0,0,@martinb3 Sorry, we don't quite understand. User groups are designed to notify each member of the group. You don't want that to happen?
Slack,2,0,@christieish 23 reacjis for Glen Coco! You go, Glen Coco. But no more than that, or it’s too many emoji. Bye!
Slack,0,0,@jcampbell_05 Thank you, it does sound like you've run into an iOS bug. We're very sorry for the trouble.
Slack,0,0,@roisiproven And which mobile platform did this happen on?
Slack,1,0,@psobot Thank you!
Slack,1,0,@ahernandezlopez If you're having trouble please get in touch at feedback@slack.com. Our iOS team will help.
Slack,0,0,@psobot That's certainly unexpected. Which platform did this happen on?
Slack,1,0,@roisiproven Hmmm, that's unexpected. Was it a particularly long username?
Slack,1,0,@dekaru  Nope! The manually uploaded avatar takes precedence. 📷
Slack,0,0,@sjeklinski Can you go into the main app menu and choose Help > Clear Cache and Restart? Any difference after that?
Slack,0,0,@matt_porter_ Sorry about that. It's a known issue we're working to improve.
Slack,0,0,@sjeklinski That's... not right. Did you recently change your system language? 🤔
Slack,0,0,@psobot Was it waiting as a draft when you had a connection again?
Slack,0,0,@EskilRyndarien Ahh, got it. That's not something we have planned right now, but it's an interesting idea! We'll pass it along. 📱➡️💻
Slack,0,0,@psmishra Thanks for letting us know about this! 😳
Slack,1,0,@dekaru Avatars uploaded manually after updating your gravatar should override your gravatar. 👍
Slack,3,1,@kylepkuo Our favourite Skrillex song is Bangarang. It’s a head banger(ang).
Slack,0,0,@MatGosselin 🙌
Slack,0,0,@PaulLomax We have, and we know change is hard, but we're here for you! 💖  Let us know if you have questions. feedback@slack.com
Slack,0,0,@morid1n We're so sorry about this! What specifically is plaguing you? We'll look into it.
Slack,1,0,@van_miranda Clever idea! 💡 We'll make sure the team takes a look.
Slack,0,0,@criscmaia No plans at the moment, but we can pass this along as a feature request!
Slack,0,0,@psobot Yikes, that's no good! 😨 To recap: You were in a DM, typed a message, and when you hit send, the message text just disappeared?
Slack,0,0,@criscmaia There's no way to see who deleted a message via the api. 🙃
Slack,0,0,@farhanmohamed On second thought, it looks like you might have toggled off "Include a preview" in your notification preferences (cmd-,).
Slack,0,0,@bpratdesaba Sorry about this! Please try hitting shift + esc, and let us know if that clears the badges. 🔕
Slack,1,0,@jstrauss We hear you, and we're looking into improving this! Thanks for your patience. 🙌
Slack,0,0,@MatGosselin No plans at this time, but we'll let the team know it's something you'd like to see!  🎶
Slack,1,0,@cjscheper Not everything needs to be round! But our app icon does. For now. 🔵
Slack,0,0,@jonnyzzz Oh no!  🤔By chance, were you using Slack on your desktop when these messages were sent?
Slack,0,0,@psmishra Hmm. How exactly are you initiating that call?
Slack,0,0,@DeborahLee89 😢This is a known bug we're trying to squash. 🐛 We'll let you know when we've fixed it. So sorry for the trouble right now! 🐛 🚧
Slack,1,0,@alikrausman We hear you, that'd be pretty neat. We'll share the idea with the team. 👯
Slack,0,0,@cdownie Good questions! 1. No good reason now, but it's something we're looking into. 2. Not currently, but leave the idea with us. 🤔
Slack,1,0,@heyyPJ Thank *you*! 🚀
Slack,2,0,@brendantnorris @charliedeets It is indeed like that in order to honor the team admin's security needs. We hear this a lot, though. 💭
Slack,0,0,@jcampbell_05  😭 You might be running into a known bug. 🐛 Which version of the Slack iOS app are you using? We'll check in with the team.
Slack,0,0,@ShadowmarN Change is difficult. We're here to help. ❤️
Slack,0,0,@tvanantwerp 💡 That's an idea! Thanks for sharing this with us!
Slack,1,0,@jcampbell_05 Yikes, we're sorry for the trouble. Could you let us know what you mean by lost your details? We'd like to investigate this. 🙇
Slack,1,0,@ScottSmith95 Just a little off the top! https://t.co/J3bTRrjgeU
Slack,1,0,@megankhenry Oh, that's usually when the good stuff's about to be posted! https://t.co/v6GNpmCnLT
Slack,1,0,@ben_seven Sorry about that! https://t.co/Hiy1BgB4C1
Slack,0,0,@ben_seven In the mobile apps it's not possible to do this — they're ordered alphabetically. However, we'll let the team know you want this!
Slack,0,0,@mossiodotco We don't have an in-built command, but there are several gif integrations — it may be one has been removed from your team.
Slack,1,0,@mpaarating It’s not currently on the roadmap, but we’ll consider it for the future. Thanks for the suggestion! 📝
Slack,0,0,@caschod You can always find one to suit your team on our App Directory: https://t.co/avX6I8dDcN. ✨
Slack,1,0,@shakerdev (But on a slightly more serious note, it's something that we've heard a lot of feedback about and are looking into!)
Slack,1,0,@shakerdev Cat...says...dark mode......must...have...dark mode — HEY! We see what you did there. Sneaky, using cats. 🐈
Slack,1,0,@HamidHCS Not about this, at least! 😉😘
Slack,1,0,@juliandoesstuff 🙈🙈🙈
Slack,0,0,@GeorgeAHallam At present users can DM any other team member they can see in Slack. We'll let the team know you'd like more control of this.
Slack,0,0,@AntonMihailov We hear you, and it's something we're looking to improve. In future, we hope for Comments to work more like Threads. 🎈
Slack,0,0,@theotherreceive Good thought — we really appreciate the feedback. Every little bit helps! 🌸
Slack,0,0,@GrandLogicInc Thank you for the feedback. We hear you — there's always room for improvement!
Slack,0,0,@PhABCD Oh no! It's not possible to remove the command, but if you can please write in to feedback@slack.com we can investigate this.
Slack,0,0,@FGRibreau If you'd like to have a chat about our plans, you can always write to us at feedback@slack.com! 🦋
Slack,1,0,@izi8000 It's nothing drastic, but we did have a minor makeover! 💅✨
Slack,2,0,@nicsmcnally @Techies4TS Orange is the new Slack!
Slack,0,0,@akhilgupta_me Many thanks! 🐖🌼🌳🌸🐔
Slack,0,0,@amaccuish Hmm, mind resetting the cache? If that doesn't help, drop us a line to feedback@slack.com and we can dig in deeper! 🤔🔎
Slack,1,0,@julegamache 🙌 Yay, we're so glad to hear that! We're always here if you need a hand.
Slack,0,0,@Level20EastGuy Oh, that's odd! If you drop us a line to feedback@slack.com we can take a look into this for you! 🙏
Slack,0,0,@dayle_design Eep, we have a known bug with overexcited spellcheckers that we're working on — sorry about this! 🐛
Slack,0,0,@julegamache Hmm, you should have the same experience — what exactly are you seeing on Windows? 🤔
Slack,1,0,@zistooshort You gotta do what you gotta do! 🦋
Slack,0,0,@HamidHCS Arf, we have a bug that we're trying to squash with this at the moment. Please bear with us! 🐛🐻
Slack,0,0,@ream88 💅😘💖
Slack,1,0,@bmeakin https://t.co/QxgOxPT5Zm
Slack,1,0,@galenking Interesting. That's certainly one we'll pass on to the team — thanks for the suggestion! 🌸
Slack,0,0,@ragnarkarlsson Alas, you can only have the order displays with newest at the bottom! We may give it more thought in future.
Slack,0,0,@villesundberg The App Store may sometimes be a little behind what with app approvals and the like. Sorry about that!
Slack,1,0,@admirim No, afraid not. It's not something that's on our roadmap at the minute but we'll be sure to pass your feedback onto the team here 📝
Slack,1,0,@robertgaal WE STILL THINK YOU'RE GREAT 💕
Slack,0,0,@smashman2004 We're on it! Sorry for the long wait. 🙌
Slack,1,0,@aviaryan123 If you go to https://t.co/oUb433Gxi1 and enter all email addresses you use, we'll send you a list of your accounts and teams!
Slack,1,0,@robertgaal Neat idea! We'll pass this along to the team for consideration.
Slack,0,0,@ysihaoy That's our pleasure! Also, sorry about the sudden change — we're trying to align our app icons across the board!
Slack,0,0,@villesundberg So sorry! Mind trying to see if a fresh install of v2.6.3 fixes this strange read state behavior? https://t.co/tqv3hLFP8X
Slack,0,0,@WazzaEdition It's still a thing! We're making an effort to align all the current app icons.
Slack,0,0,@prashantdilse Thanks for bearing with us! 💖
Slack,0,0,@prashantdilse Ah, sorry about this. We're currently tracking an issue with the read/unread state and hope to have this patched up soon. 🙏
Slack,0,0,@SahilC0 Thanks, friend! We quite like them, so we're glad to hear that you do too! 🎉🎉
Slack,0,0,@paulkarambo It's still a thing! Just trying to keep our app icons consistent across all platforms! ✨
Slack,1,0,@sydneyx Excellent, then you should be fine! There's some compression when uploading via iOS, but there's none on the desktop app. 😃
Slack,0,0,@PurelyScott We're sorry it's not your cup of tea! Time moves on and we must evolve! 🕰️
Slack,0,0,@jorilallo So, so sorry, Jori. We're fixing this as quickly as possible.
Slack,0,0,@maccaw Not at all, friend! We know it's a pain to deal with, and we're most certainly still working away at it. A fix is on its way! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@sydneyx In most cases, yes! Images will stay at their original resolution. From which devices are you uploading and downloading from?
Slack,1,0,@tyler_hedrick Good eyes. 😼
Slack,0,0,@farhanmohamed That's strange! There should be a title next to 'uploaded this image'. What version is your Mac app? We haven't made changes!
Slack,0,0,@KingsdsNetwork We're always thinking about our native invite features, considering the best balance between speed and keeping teams secure.
Slack,2,0,@rena_tom Welcome to the future! The coffee here is pretty good. 👌☕️
Slack,1,0,@M_c_Ruer Ah, our apologies! 😞🐛 We're looking into an issue where the app gets a bit bogged down by large chunks of Unicode. So sorry! 👾
Slack,0,0,@galenking Hmm, if a channel hasn't had any activity for a set period of time? 🤔📝
Slack,0,0,@dstrelau Oh gosh, we didn't mean to cause a fuss! 🙈 It was just time for some spring cleaning. Summer/winter cleaning? 🤔🤷‍♀️🛁
Slack,0,0,@dalefraser We'll pass your request to the team. Thank you for sharing. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@E3Writing No lightweight version sorry. Though we'll pass this across to the team. Setting your message display to compact might help? 🙇
Slack,0,0,@The_JoshOConnor No, YOU ARE! ⛷💐🏌
Slack,3,0,@saraclay15 We did give it a bit of a spruce. Nice catch! 🎣🏆
Slack,1,0,@JoeyEC We jazzed it up a little. 😉🎷🎺💃
Slack,2,0,@paulcanetti ✨😊🏂
Slack,0,0,@zegolf ✨✨🔮✨✨
Slack,0,0,@mattyohe Glad you dig it! 😍✨⛷
Slack,0,0,@psomebody 🍦+👕 =😭😭😭😭😭
Slack,1,0,@hkdobrev Yep, gotcha. More customizability around the sidebar features is on our radar. Thanks for sharing! ✨😊🏄
Slack,0,0,@CryptoRacer Are you running into connectivity trouble across your team? Please let us know and we'll look into it! 🙌
Slack,0,0,@zegolf We sure did! Nice catch. 👌🏻
Slack,0,0,@ben_thenwecan Why hello there, Ben! Are you looking for information about our plans? If so, please see: https://t.co/JB8bKiRisj. 😀
Slack,0,0,@haynes The app icon you mean? Heh, sorry. We did tweak it just a little. 🙈
Slack,0,0,@mommyguru Hmm, are you redirected to your team if you head to https://t.co/nqZzB7wTUL? 🤔
Slack,0,0,@lyspeth Thanks for the feedback, Alexis. It's not possible to make this optional, however, we'll share your comments with our team. 👍🏼
Slack,0,0,@ericcbin Sorry for the hassle! Reducing the number of teams you're signed into may help. If not, please drop us a line: feedback@slack.com.
Slack,0,0,@tonywhitelive Oh! An interactive zebra, now that's an idea! We're sorry to say that's not on our roadmap at this time. 🙈
Slack,0,0,@farhanmohamed Hmm, do you mind clarifying what thing we're talking about and the operating system? 🙌
Slack,1,1,@codilicious 💅🏼 ✨
Slack,0,0,@lambrocalrisian You're on the ball! ⚾️
Slack,0,0,@danhaddock_irl Thanks for the feedback! We'll let the Android team know. 💕
Slack,1,0,@ktzhu We're sorry for the continued trouble. We may need to help out here. Could you write in to feedback@slack.com? We'll take a look! 👀
Slack,0,0,@eriinh We recommend that you invite others to your team. Maybe you can invite some bots to your team and they can help the conversation?🙈
Slack,0,0,@E3Writing And more then 14,000x times as big as good ol' 1K ZX Chess! We're spoiled these days, really. 👑
Slack,0,0,@psomebody What kind of ice cream? 🤔
Slack,0,0,@ktzhu Oh no! This looks to be a bug. Did you just update to 3.22? If so, could you try deleting and reinstalling the app? 🙏🏽
Slack,0,0,@failvarez Nothing that should have caused anything like that! Is the slowdown only affecting certain actions, or everything in your team? 🤔
Slack,0,0,@SarahKSquire That's quite a lot of tabs: our desktop apps might be a good alternative in that case. Were they not a good fit for you?
Slack,0,0,@fchevitarese That's good to hear! Hopefully we'll be able to lend a hand from there. Thanks for your patience.
Slack,0,0,@The_JoshOConnor Oh, consolidation of those alerts would make a lot of sense, even just as an option! We'll mention this to our iOS team. 🔕📱
Slack,0,0,@lambrocalrisian Ah, yes, we did indeed change our icon a little in the latest iOS release. Good eye! Hopefully you still like it? 😅
Slack,1,0,@MattNavarra  I'm afraid we cannot view your team this way. Please write in to our team and we will investigate further for you! 🔎
Slack,1,0,@MattNavarra We aren't seeing any issues on our end. Please write to feedback@slack.com with your team details and we'll take a closer look.
Slack,2,0,@notnownikki Great suggestion here! We’re exploring this idea, so stay tuned.💡
Slack,0,0,@SirOpsALot That would be sensible. Thanks for sending this idea our way! We'll pass it along to the team. ⭐
Slack,1,0,@tweets_so_fresh Not quite a hotkey but just in case it helps there is a slash command: /mute
Slack,0,0,@cryonnetwork If it was unwanted we’d recommend speaking with your team admin about that team member. 2/2
Slack,0,0,@cryonnetwork From the screenshot it looks like someone on your team set a reminder for you. 1/2
Slack,0,0,@Hayotje Is it not appearing for you somewhere it should?
Slack,1,0,@techno_goober 🙈
Slack,0,0,@RegLevy Do you have a link to one of those notes? We will clear up the confusion there.
Slack,0,0,@RegLevy You can drag the team icons to rearrange them in the desktop app.
Slack,0,0,@RegLevy Although we’re unable to implement every feature request, we truly appreciate receiving these requests.
Slack,0,0,@fchevitarese We're sorry to hear about the trouble. Please write to feedback@slack.com so our team can look into this.
Slack,0,0,@Skarin We'll let the team know this is something you'd really like to see soon!
Slack,1,0,@SanderBlue It's not there by default, but you can certainly add it to your team. We'll just leave this here... https://t.co/Tly0GdV0H8 🙃
Slack,1,0,@ivancantarino We're so glad you like them!
Slack,0,0,@PmPyne Unless a Team Owner has explicitly restricted message editing to within a timeframe, you should be able to: https://t.co/SjowN44RdN
Slack,1,0,@jmxd_ You are not going crazy. We tweaked it just a tad. 🌈
Slack,0,0,@feldman Anytime! Have a wonderful day! 💖
Slack,0,0,@stuartpreston Great! ✨
Slack,0,0,@stuartpreston Ah, there is no 24-hour Do not disturb mode. You could change your notifications to "Nothing" though! 💡
Slack,2,2,@kylepkuo Shaquille O'Neal, the great NBA(nana) player.
Slack,0,0,@MattEnth 😱 We're so sorry for the persistent All Threads badge. That is our best workaround. We're trying to squash this bug for good. 🐛🔨
Slack,1,0,@IanScarffe And turning off Prefs > Accessibility > Allow Animated Images/Emoji can help, as these can be CPU hungry processes. 2/2
Slack,1,0,@IanScarffe Yum eggs, but also yikes! Sorry. Logging out of unused teams, as well as turning off Prefs > Inline Media & Links settings 1/2
Slack,0,0,@brygibbs We are hiring! Take a gander at our careers page! https://t.co/UzXwhFXn7i
Slack,1,0,@gcerquant Sorry for the confusion, that's a totally reasonable expectation. We'll pass the feedback along to the team.
Slack,0,0,@MrAdamBullock 😭 This is a known and terribly frustrating bug. We're doing our best to resolve this as soon as we can.🐛 🛠
Slack,0,0,@dansteif Nothing new to report, sorry. Read receipts aren't something on our immediate roadmap, but we're always listening to feedback!
Slack,0,0,@abigailzdg As in a :wtf: emoji? You can make custom emojis for your team! https://t.co/WH6XJUssDX
Slack,0,0,@jcedborger Definitely something we think about. We'll pass your suggestion along. Thanks for the feedback!
Slack,1,0,@jaysonwhelpley Yup, there is a way! In Preferences > Messages & Media > uncheck "Show images and files from linked websites." ✨
Slack,0,0,@feldman You may ignore @-channel and @-here in channel-specific notification preferences! @-mentions cannot be muted. Hope this helps!
Slack,0,0,@treycausey Yikes, so sorry about this! Could you write to feedback@slack.com? We want to investigate this for you. 🙏
Slack,0,0,@brygibbs This isn't possible at this time, but this is a neat idea! We'll share this with the team. ✌
Slack,0,0,@treycausey Let us know how this goes too. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@treycausey 😭 This is a known bug on iOS. Could you clear your cache for us? Open Slack and swipe left to Settings > Advanced > Reset Cache.
Slack,1,0,@FierceDaily In Windows you can use their built in Speech Recognition: https://t.co/FGIw9l2YT2
Slack,0,0,@tuck183 ...team, Slack stops automatically populating that list. 2/2
Slack,0,0,@tuck183 That's essentially how it works, yes. The list only shows up to 23 DMs at a time, so once there are a lot of members in the... 1/2
Slack,0,0,@comzeradd  We see what you mean. Thanks for sharing this feedback!
Slack,0,0,@tuck183 But new members will still show up there when they join on smaller teams.
Slack,0,0,@tuck183 Actually, If you hover over the members in left bar, do you see an ( x ) beside the names? You should be able to close those DMs.
Slack,0,0,@VisionWebSoft Would you mind dropping a note to feedback@slack.com so we can dig in a bit into what might be going on? Sorry about that!
Slack,0,0,@tuck183 There aren't any features in the paid plans that would help with that specifically, we're afraid, but we'll pass this feedback on.
Slack,0,0,@jcedborger Something we're considering, for sure. Are you imagining them grouped for the whole team, or by each person's choice?
Slack,0,0,@FierceDaily We just mean the ones built into your phone/device/computer, such as Dictation on Mac and iOS.
Slack,0,0,@RonellSharee Your mobile apps will then default to that option as well. Hope that helps! 2/2
Slack,0,0,@RonellSharee If you're using the desktop app, you can click the 'skin tone' button in the emoji picker to set your default skin tone. 1/2
Slack,0,0,@tehtrav Hmm… haven't heard of that one before. Would you mind writing in to feedback@slack.com with some details so we can investigate?
Slack,0,0,@PrestoD That goes to the same place, yes! Thanks, and our team will investigate. Again, our apologies. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@EskilRyndarien Hmm, so you mean logging in remotely from your desktop? 🤔 (Or are the links not working on your phone perhaps?)
Slack,0,0,@IAmNotCyril https://t.co/iJRl607a1H
Slack,0,0,@IAmNotCyril Sorry. 😢
Slack,1,0,@fUZZItweets Oh no! We're sorry to hear it. If it continues, could you please send us a report through "Help" in your app's menu?
Slack,0,0,@PrestoD That's most odd, so sorry! Do you mind dropping a note to feedback@slack.com so we can investigate further? 🔍
Slack,2,0,@danfairs So sorry! We're working hard to improve this — it's a top priority for the team right now. Please do bear with us!
Slack,0,0,@brianfagioli It is! We updated the icon in the latest release 😊
Slack,0,0,@tuck183 In which case they will see any members who are also in the channels they are in 2/2
Slack,0,0,@tuck183 We're afraid it's not possible to prevent new users from seeing the full team directory unless they are guest users 1/2
Slack,0,0,@tuck183 Ah! We have a help guide on organizing your sidebar:  https://t.co/ycGBnj9Njr. You can set it so that just unread material appears!
Slack,0,0,@chuise Hmm, have you tried resetting the cache at any point by any chance? This can sometimes help when the issue is in the app only 🙏
Slack,0,0,@tuck183 We generally ask that more detailed requests please go to /feedback or feedback@slack.com. Thanks!
Slack,0,0,@tuck183 We'd just like to clarify, are you referring to the members list within channels or was it something else?
Slack,0,0,@mattgawarecki Thanks for the idea! We will share that with the team 🙌
Slack,0,0,@rudyrichter We've changed that to cmd+shift+enter based on user feedback (people found themselves pressing it too much by mistake)!
Slack,0,0,@chuise Sounds like you're having some connectivity troubles. We're sorry 😞 Is this happening on the app, the browser, or both perhaps?
Slack,0,0,@feldman This is so that you don't lose visibility of messages that could be important for you to see while your channels are muted.
Slack,0,0,@JudithStr From the app you can type /feedback, or else you can email feedback@slack.com. Thanks so much :)
Slack,1,0,@marcelokanzaki Sorry for this inconvenience, this is a known bug we're currently working on. We hope you can bear with us a little longer 🙏
Slack,0,0,@SynteZZZ We're sorry! We'd like to discuss further with you though and could do with some more room 🙏Will do our very best to help :)
Slack,0,0,@bangasho We'll certainly pass this feedback on for you! Sorry that we don't offer the UX you're looking for right now Omair.
Slack,0,0,@DCDoughnut You'll have to be an Admin or Owner! Here are the instructions to do so:  https://t.co/qXilN9LNyX
Slack,0,0,@JudithStr 😱We'd love to troubleshoot this and get some more detail if you don't mind. Could you please reach out to /feedback? Thanks! 🙏
Slack,0,0,@adamgriffiths A little bit plumper, yes! 😊
Slack,0,0,@giromide We did!
Slack,0,0,@SynteZZZ Oof, that sounds like a known bug we're working on. If you drop a line to feedback@slack.com we'll see what we can do. 🐛
Slack,0,0,@dmilith We understand the navigation can be frustrating — we'll try to do this better the next time around. Thank you for your patience.
Slack,0,0,@camellia_will https://t.co/BNwVVra8Hh
Slack,1,0,@Inversal_svq @myetherwallet Sorry to hear this! If you can write in to feedback@slack.com we can take a closer look at this issue.
Slack,0,0,@jonmcp 🙌✨
Slack,0,0,@RussellHMSmith Alas, without resorting to a game of Whispers, there's no other way to do this right now — sorry!
Slack,1,0,@weekstweets Aw shucks, we try! 🌸💖
Slack,0,0,@jonmcp Oops! We made some changes, but you should be able to do this using cmd + shift + return. Sorry for the confusion. 🙈
Slack,0,0,@RussellHMSmith The best option is to create a new private channel and invite everyone else in! 🎈🍰
Slack,0,0,@dcondrau Yikes. If you don't mind writing in to feedback@slack.com we can take a closer look for you!
Slack,0,0,@kennydude  Disappearing? Gosh, that's not good. Can you please write to us at feedback@slack.com so we can take a closer look? 🔎
Slack,1,0,@MrLoh Ah, that's a good catch! We'll take a look to see if we can update it there too. Thanks for sharing! 😄
Slack,0,0,@prayas26 Ah, would you mind terribly writing in to feedback@slack.com so we can troubleshoot further? 🔎 🙇
Slack,1,0,@kostas_menu Thanks for being honest, we'll share this with the team! 🙏
Slack,0,0,@lukejdarling Great to hear! Don't hesitate to reach back out if you run into any other issues.
Slack,0,0,@OrfulComics  It’s not sad. It’s lovely! As are you! ❤️  Oh, and the leprechauns. They have a wonderful way with words 📓
Slack,0,0,@SynteZZZ If you navigate to Slack on your desktop and click "shift-esc" here, this should clear things on your Android app. 🤞
Slack,0,0,@kennydude Hmm, are you looking to view all threads at once? Or to have a specific thread viewable just by you? 🤔
Slack,0,0,@dcondrau Hmm, apologies for the frustration! If you click "shift-esc" when you're in a channel (and not in All Threads), does it clear? 🤞
Slack,0,0,@productoven Gosh, that's so wonderful to hear! Thank you for sharing , it really makes us smile! ☺️ 🤗
Slack,1,0,@rogehsworld We're definitely considering our options here. We want to make sure we make use of this feature n the best way. ✨ 🙇
Slack,0,0,@kostas_menu We're working to unify our app icons across the board. If you have any feedback, don't hesitate to let us know! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@lukejdarling Oh no, Luke! That's not good. Can you let me know which app this is happening on? 🔎
Slack,0,0,@IanScarffe  We've some tips that can help! Can you please send us a note to feedback@slack.com? We'd love to help you with this!
Slack,0,0,@pabbalca Great catch! We did make a small change. Hopefully it's easier on the eye. 😉
Slack,0,0,@interestingmix There isn't but if you write in to feedback@slack.com, we might have some similar suggestions. 📝  🙇
Slack,0,0,@pabbalca Hmm, what appears to be different? 🔎  👀
Slack,0,0,@aayanzillis We'll pass this along as a feature request to the team here. Thank you! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@_JasonMurray Thanks for letting us know Jason! We'll share that feedback with the team here. 💕

Slack,0,0,@apiousman Thanks for the kind words! 🔗
Slack,0,0,@ekettoz Gotcha - we're definitely aware of some cases where channels/DMs do not immediately update as 'read'. We hope this is fixed soon! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@johncaffeine Makes sense! 😂
Slack,0,0,@ekettoz Sorry about this, Tom! Mind letting us know which app and version you and the team are seeing this occur on?
Slack,0,0,@jeremybeasley Oh, are you seeing this occur when searching within the same Slack team or when switching between different teams? 🔍
Slack,1,0,@emilyooo Well then! Naw, you're not going crazy. We gave the icon a little polish with the latest update! 🕵🏻‍♀️
Slack,0,0,@johncaffeine Ah, gotcha! For now, providing different alignment options aren't currently on the roadmap, but we hear ya, John!
Slack,1,0,@dinchamion 😼🏏
Slack,111,7,@KarlTheFog Fun fact: Slack HQ has a meeting room named for you. Bunch of small ones named after 'hoods. And then a… https://t.co/fUz3ZNCLbX
Slack,0,0,@nirexx Strange! Is the person mentioned holding a guest account? Drop us some details and we'll investigate: https://t.co/WeWXcwsZIU 🔍
Slack,0,0,@nexon That's not good enough. 😔 Could you drop us a note via Settings > Submit Feedback? We'll look into it.
Slack,1,0,@kate_ugh Yay! Sorry for the oddness but just give us a shout if it's still wonky. 🙌
Slack,0,0,@johncaffeine Well maybe not an interesting one but: we think it looks clean! Is there a reason you'd find aligning other way better? 💫
Slack,0,0,@interestingmix Ah, gotcha! We're afraid they won't get an email unless they've subscribed to email notifications. Sorry about that!
Slack,1,0,@kate_ugh That's odd! Does a reinstall offer you a prompt to enable notifications on your phone?
Slack,0,0,@caiocooter 🙈 Sorry to hear that! Do you mind dropping us a note at https://t.co/WeWXcwsZIU? We'll help!
Slack,1,0,@grumpygamer Thank you for the kind words! For the record, we could never be mad at you. 💓
Slack,0,0,@johncaffeine We don't have a particular reason, but thanks for the feedback! It's something we can think about. 💭
Slack,0,0,@interestingmix If they have the channel muted they will still see a badged notification next to the channel name.
Slack,1,0,@CCSMrThompson 🙇 Sorry about that! You should have seen the option if your team creator had specified using Slack for school initially.
Slack,0,0,@interestingmix By default all users in a team are in the #general channel, so this would send a notification to everyone in the team.
Slack,0,0,@interestingmix You could drop an "@channel" message in the #general channel kindly asking users to delete any private channels.
Slack,0,0,@firstheart42 Ah! Slash commands can only be made directly from the app for now — sorry for the disappointment! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@dontrebootme @yvov Sorry about this! Does Shift + Esc help to remove the badge? (Warning: this will clear all your unreads!)
Slack,1,0,@ComplicitOwl Ah, apologies, we were looking at the desktop app. It'd be nice if everything matched, we'll take a look. 👀
Slack,1,0,@victorkernes 😘
Slack,0,0,@stantonk We appreciate this isn't always handy and we'll give it some more thought. Sorry, friend! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@stantonk Yes, we're afraid this setting can only be adjusted after the multi-party DM gets started.
Slack,0,0,@ComplicitOwl Hmm, we see an Oxford comma in the list of users when we hover over a reacji. 🤔 Could you send a screenshot, please?
Slack,1,0,@victorkernes We're so pleased you like it! 🙌🖼
Slack,1,0,@brettgodfrey Oh, Brett! You're making us blush. 😊🌹
Slack,0,0,@crouhana Sorry for the change! This update brings it in line with the other app icons, so we're all matching. 👯👯‍♂️
Slack,0,0,@HeckYeahMan Nice. 😬📸🍔
Slack,0,0,@stantonk By default, we only push mentions or keywords. To change, tap the DM name, then choose Notifications > All new messages.
Slack,0,0,@stantonk Ah, yes, actually! 💡 Multi-party DM notifications are more like channel notifications.
Slack,0,0,@gifkeyboard Yikes! 🔥🐕🔥
Slack,6,0,@Backdoorcook A dark/night theme for Slack? We hear you and we're giving it some thought. 🌙
Slack,2,0,@SeanLagged Gosh, you're very welcome! 🤗 Thank YOU for reading them!
Slack,1,0,@mgriffiss We hear you and we'll let the team know that you'd like to see this in Slack. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@altcoinio Nope — admins are just like everyone else here. They can view their own reminders and channel reminders. 🗓✅
Slack,1,0,@ideafella 😅 Slack pun aside... Thanks, friend! 🤗
Slack,110,8,We're happy to report that all users should be able to access their teams once more. We appreciate you sticking with us on this one. 🙇 💖🙌
Slack,0,0,@EWDurbin We're pretty sure it's the same size as all the others… 🤔📐
Change can be startling, we hope it becomes the new normal soon. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@raulriera Why, thank you! 📱💅✨
Slack,0,0,@EWDurbin Jarring because it's brand new and a little bit different? 😬
Slack,0,0,@AllonsyRachel @bmvaughn If that doesn't help, please drop us a line and we'll take a look: feedback@slack.com
Slack,0,0,@bmvaughn @AllonsyRachel 👋 We had a little blip earlier today, but you should be able to connect now. Please try Cmd/Ctrl + T to refresh.

Slack,0,0,@EUNI_Titus You should be able to connect now. 🤞 Please try refreshing with Cmd/Ctrl + R and let us know how it goes. 💜
Slack,3,0,@jonyheim Ah, yes! The iOS icon has changed a little. We gave it a good dust and polish and buffed out some scratches. ✨
Slack,0,0,@ssuleman Hurrah! Thanks so much for bearing with us. 🐻💝
Slack,1,0,@meg_quintero Phew, excellent news! 👏 Thank you for being patient with us. 💖
Slack,0,0,@jonyheim Erm, which one? Or do you mean our Twitter picture? (That one's a recent change, yes.) 🌈
Slack,0,0,@EUNI_Titus We're working on it, Titus. ⚡️ We're very sorry for the trouble. You can follow along here: https://t.co/WqzwGMKAyT

Slack,0,0,@ChaseGiunta Sorry about this! We're having a moment, but it should be fixed soon.

 Thanks for bearing with us.
Slack,0,0,@HootMar Gosh, we're so sorry! We're working to get the site updated and the issue fixed. 🛠
Slack,1,0,@meg_quintero 🙀 Oh no! We're working on it, please hold tight, Meg. So sorry for the disruption. 💛
Slack,0,0,@randomJoss Ah, apologies, friend! We're looking into the issue and working to get updates out as fast as we can. Please hold tight. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@robbiegarvey Yikes! We're so sorry, Robbie. We're looking into it right now. 🚧
Slack,1,0,@LBKinson That emoji is part of an updated set that we don't yet support. Sorry! We're working on it! 🏃🏽‍♀️💨
Slack,0,0,@interestingmix No, there's no way to see how much storage space an individual user is taking up. We're sorry for the inconvenience here.
Slack,0,0,@AyaAkl @DeborahLee89 @FriendlyTester You can double check the version from your Slack "Settings" > "About".
Slack,0,0,@AyaAkl @FriendlyTester @DeborahLee89 Oh no! Hmmm. Could you check to see what version of the Slack app you're running? We're on 3.22 now.
Slack,0,0,@bibulb It'd certainly have some handy uses! Thanks for taking the time to reach out, we'll be sure to pass your feedback through. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@FriendlyTester @DeborahLee89 Ack, sorry! Richard's idea could work. You can also clear the cache from Settings > Advanced > Reset Cache.
Slack,0,0,@interestingmix Unfortunately there's no way to access privately-shared files that are not your own, we're afraid. Even as a team admin. 😓

Slack,1,0,@FabulousRice Thanks for the feedback. We'll definitely think about it! 😅
Slack,1,1,@drbrain @austinspires We changed the shortcut a while back for consistency reasons, but ⌘ + Shift + Enter should still do the trick! 🎩 🐰
Slack,0,0,@TicTacTia Hi! We're currently looking into these bugs – are you noticing this is only happening on iOS? Or do you use Mac or Windows too?
Slack,0,0,@davepermen Thanks! It's a highly requested feature, and we're considering how to make it best work with Slack's other moving parts. 🛠
Slack,5,0,@Hacker_Horse Ooooh. Thanks for letting us know you'd like to see AWK syntax highlighting in snippets. We've made a note of it. 📝
Slack,0,0,@IanDeRanieri There's a setting to enable GIF previews instead of just auto-sending. Ask your team admin! They can enable GIPHY previews. 😉
Slack,0,0,@firstheart42 Hmm, we have a known bug with *any* type of reply from Mac desktop alerts. Do other non-slash command replies work for you? 🤔
Slack,0,0,@betacar No trouble at all! You know where to find us if there's anything else we can do to help! 🐧
Slack,1,0,@rajashree_28 Oh, hey! Glad to hear you figured it out. 👏🏼
Slack,1,0,@alex_casalboni We use Javascript to rewrite the favicon URL. Rewriting the URL is enough to cause the browser to change the image!
Slack,0,0,@DylanCahoon9 Oh no! Would you be able to uninstall/reinstall the app? It should work just fine with a fresh install! 🌱
Slack,0,0,@RedYetiCo Oh no, indeed! 🙀 Our apologies! Can you please send a note to slackshop@slack.com so we can sort this out? 📝
Slack,0,0,@marooned1979 Holy moly, /remind us to stop blushing after reading this. 😍
Slack,1,0,@corinamanea Oh dear that's not so great! Could you please write in so we can get details? feedback@slack.com
Slack,1,0,@VincentColavin Not at the moment, sorry! We see how that could be handy though. We'll share this with the team for some consideration. 💖
Slack,0,0,@petematheson ...the app should fix things up. So sorry for the trouble, though. 🙅🐛 2/2
Slack,0,0,@petematheson Rats, you're running into a pesky bug that we're working to fix right now. In the meantime, uninstalling & reinstalling... 1/2
Slack,0,0,@altcoinio No plans to share at the moment but we'll happily pass your feedback on to the team! Thanks for sending your thoughts our way.💌
Slack,1,0,@BuskerOne Good grief! It may help to clear your cache – head to Help> Clear Cache & Restart from the top menubar of the screen to do this.✨
Slack,0,0,@altcoinio No, unfortunately not. 😶
Slack,0,1,@altcoinio It's not possible to delete other users' personal Slackbot reminders. Sorry for the bad news! 🤖
Slack,0,0,@BuskerOne Yikes, that doesn't right! Where are you seeing the "flash effect"? On the App Icon, or in the app itself? 🤔⚡️
Slack,0,0,@colindean Brilliant! Have you looked for something like this in the App Directory? https://t.co/h4YLd6QGDp
Slack,0,0,@Veidit Aah, that's very kind. Thank you. 💛
Slack,2,0,@fedesaraviab Typing "M" should toggle mute on and off. Take a look at the "Call Actions" section here for others! https://t.co/xlNiIVucEr
Slack,0,0,@Frngtstc Ah, we see. Can the integration be un-muted on your side? As for tweets unfurling like normal websites, we'll pass that along.
Slack,1,0,@claren Our security team is looking in to this, apologies for the trouble!
Slack,2,0,@oliverdunk_ Sort of like `@here` but for user groups. Not possible at the moment but certainly an interesting idea. We'll pass it along! 📝
Slack,3,1,@yarnaesthetic Your company is truly EGGSellent when it comes to puns. Quite impressed. 👏 🍳 👏 🍳 👏
Slack,0,0,@Frngtstc You'll need to authenticate a Twitter account to see previews. Do you have an account connected here? https://t.co/LYMfpKy1XG
Slack,0,0,@betacar Gah! Sorry! We've seen a few reports of this and working on a fix. Is your Slack zoom set at 100%? (Preferences > Accessibility)
Slack,0,0,@howdyasser Thanks for the idea! We don't have any plans for this at the moment, but we'll share this will our team for future thought! 🚀
Slack,0,0,@betacar Oh no not that! Could you try refreshing or resetting your app data and see if that helps? Otherwise, feedback@slack.com?
Slack,1,0,@adampatterson You can delete files from inactive from https://t.co/7NUNu6dTjS, and the team is carefully considering other options.
Slack,1,0,@_brotzky Thank you for letting us know, Dennis! We really appreciate it. We'll fix this bug! ☺️ 🐛

Slack,0,0,@CryptoFR Sorry to hear about the trouble! It's not possible to remove @-mentions in reminders. We'll pass along the feature request though.
Slack,0,0,@mboylevt Hey Matt! There isn't a way to bulk delete channels. We'll let our team know that this is a feature you'd like to see! 🙏🏽
Slack,0,0,@dgrandhay Ah yes. Deactivated user files are included in your team's total file storage.
Slack,0,0,@celinasays Darn! Can you please write in to feedback@slack.com so we can try to clear it from the backend? 🙇
Slack,0,0,@absolutejam Interesting thought! 🤔 For now, you can start a thread and label it as NSFW, then thread the replies to keep them hidden.
Slack,0,0,@kirabug There's no way to reorder teams on mobile right now, but we'll let the team know you'd like to see that in the future! 📱
Slack,0,0,@IanScarffe Sorry about this! We're working on several improvements to reduce our resource consumption. How many teams are you logged into?
Slack,0,0,@eadnams That sure sounds broken! Our team would like to investigate – do you mind writing us at feedback@slack.com? Thanks! 🚂🔧
Slack,0,0,@DrDemondBledsoe Our Enterprise Grid product supplies the environment for HIPAA compliance. Reach out via https://t.co/5HugwdQQfF for info!
Slack,0,0,@mominawahab Glad it's working now! Please let us know if the issue returns.
Slack,0,0,@roach_iam We use Code Mirror for snippet support, so if it's not already in there, you're welcome to contribute!:  https://t.co/8MdmFiAm3j
Slack,1,0,@alex_casalboni Depending on your browser, yep! Anywhere the favicon is supposed to appear, we try to make it swap appropriately. ✨
Slack,0,0,@yvov Sorry that didn't prove to be a permanent fix! Please write in to feedback@slack.com so we can clear it for you from the backend. 🙇
Slack,1,0,@thisischandresh We're reading it! It sounds like a really fun idea. 😊🎬🌟
Slack,1,0,@jakobbrowning Afraid not, and we're sorry about that. We're working on a solution for this problem in the future! 🌴😴
Slack,0,0,@balonester It is a great spot to draft (and proofread!) complicated messages, too.
Slack,1,0,@__joshblack It is! Click on your username > Leave this team, then confirm and restart the app.
Slack,1,0,@jrrickard @laura_eurich Shift+Esc is not quite one button, but might work for you!
Slack,2,0,@team_salim Kindof curious about that other 10% now...
Slack,1,1,@UNCWseahawksFEM Glad to hear it! We are happy to help if you have questions.
Slack,0,0,@traviswill Let us know if we can help!
Slack,0,0,@liamsomerville Consolidated logins aren't on the roadmap for security and administrative reasons but thank you for the feedback! 🔐
Slack,0,0,@DeborahLee89 Oh no! Can you drop us a note to feedback@slack.com please? Our iOS team would love to take a closer look. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@DeborahLee89 So sorry! Can you swipe left into Settings > Advanced > Reset Cache to see if that clears it?
Slack,0,0,@fuzzybinary There is indeed! It requires a few steps so drop us a line to feedback@slack.com and we'll walk you through it. 👍
Slack,0,0,@voxpelli ...automatically suppress notifications for the timeframe that you choose until you turn off that feature. 2/2

Slack,0,0,@DCDoughnut That's across all OS.
Slack,0,0,@dgrandhay We hear you. If your team needs file storage space, you can ask team members to delete unused files from https://t.co/7NUNu6dTjS
Slack,0,0,@voxpelli No vacation mode, but you can update your DnD settings for your work teams so that you won't receive any notifications from them.
Slack,0,0,@DCDoughnut We retired the web view of message archives. Archives are now only viewable within the app.
Slack,0,0,@atif089 Afraid not, sorry! Permissions for @mentions can be changed at team-level only.
Slack,0,0,@mominawahab Is this happening on different browsers? What results do you get when running the self-help test at https://t.co/5gmpOHU2Rn?
Slack,0,0,@Rems0511 Afraid not, sorry! Private files of deactivated members stay truly private and cannot be accessed or deleted by other members.
Slack,0,0,@ebuie :-)
Slack,0,0,@EmTobey No set plans right now, but we'll pass your feedback along on this Emily!
Slack,1,0,@rubenschulz Ah, unfortunately if you're only in one team, there's no shortcut to open the chat window. We'll pass this idea to the team.
Slack,0,0,@rubenschulz Hmm, are you signed in to multiple teams, or only one? What version of the app are you using?
Slack,1,0,@YAlessandri Ahh, we do have some steps that might resolve this issue! Mind sending us a note to feedback@slack.com to discuss further?
Slack,0,0,@yvov Do you mind trying the keyboard shortcut: shift+esc and let us know if that successfully clears that notification for you? 🤞
Slack,0,0,@Firesphere 2/2....but we don't have any further details or ETA on that. We'll pass this along to the team on your behalf! 🤞
Slack,0,0,@Firesphere Not at the moment, sorry. We're currently looking at whether this is something that can be implemented in future....1/2
Slack,1,0,@paaast Yes, we're afraid this is a known issue :( Using the + icon in the message bar is the best way to upload files for now. So sorry! 💛
Slack,1,0,@JulesMariano Thanks for taking the time to let us know you'd like to see this feature! We'll pass it to the relevant team on your behalf ✍️
Slack,0,0,@HenningFemmer Great! Have a lovely day 🌈 ☀️
Slack,0,0,@hypnoboutique Hey! We welcome all feedback at Slack so please do feel free to send this to feedback@slack.com 🌟
Slack,1,0,@DirkAntonvM We'd love to investigate this further! Can you send us a note to feedback@slack.com and we'll see what might be happening? 👍
Slack,0,0,@wirosky Hmmm, what's the error you're seeing when you try to sign in? Do you have any screenshots you can share maybe?
Slack,1,0,@adymady29 You're very welcome! ❤️
Slack,0,0,@RvRoo So sorry, this is a known issue that our team are working to resolve. Mind logging this with our team at feedback@slack.com? 🙏
Slack,0,0,@hjbme Slackbot DM's can get mixed up with all your other messages from Slackbot. Here's some further information! https://t.co/F83sbExo8j
Slack,0,0,@josephheenan Sorry again. If you'd like to write in to feedback@slack.com we can share some tips that may help improve things 🤞
Slack,1,0,@HenningFemmer It's a known issue we're working on right now. Deleting the app and reinstalling should fix things up for you. Sorry! 🙏
Slack,1,0,@adymady29 Team invites are managed by team admins. Youll need to get in touch with someone from that team in order to get an invitation. ✉️
Slack,0,0,@hjbme The DM to yourself works very much as a notebook 📝; whereas Slackbot is a personal assistant that helps you do things in Slack. 🤖
Slack,0,0,@RemkoWeijnen We hear you! We'll share that thought with the team here. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@rubenschulz Does Cmd+1 do the trick?
Slack,0,0,@Gyunlim Afraid that's not possible, sorry! As a workaround, you can always add a channel topic with the channel message posting rules. 💡
Slack,0,0,@josephheenan Hopefully you should see improvements in the future, but we don't have an ETA to provide right now.
Slack,0,0,@thomasdeinhamer Sorry for the trouble, Thomas. 😞 It's a known issue that our team is working on fixing.
Slack,1,0,@lfopw So sorry! We're making improvements to the amount of resources being used, which should give you some battery back in the future. 🔋
Slack,0,0,@lancewalley Appreciate it! ✨
Slack,0,0,@lancewalley Gotcha. Mind taking screenshots of your steps, then sending the details to feedback@slack.com? It'll be easier to investigate!
Slack,0,0,@projectmyka Sorry for the trouble. It's not something we have right now, but we're listening to all feedback.
Slack,0,0,@RajarathnaVeena Thanks for the feedback! It's certainly something for us to consider. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@lancewalley Hmmm. 🤔 It should be possible from most devices. Where were you trying to upload your images from?
Slack,0,0,@celinasays Hmm, that's strange! Can you try selecting "Help" > "Clear cache and restart" and see whether that does the trick? 🙏
Slack,0,0,@noccer And our eternal gratitude, of course! 👑🐛⭐️
Slack,1,0,@noccer Yes! The prize is our super secret email address so you can tell us all about it! 😉👉 feedback@slack.com
Slack,1,0,@leafbelly Thank YOU! 🌻
Slack,0,0,@puosiveuw Sorry for all the hassle, 😓 though glad it's working again. If this issue returns, let us know and we'll dig into this with you.
Slack,0,0,@lachygroom Thanks for this solid suggestion! It's not on our roadmap, but we're happy to share this with the team. 😊
Slack,0,0,@puosiveuw Yes, we do. Let's troubleshoot this one! 👍 Could you double check your settings for us (Preferences > Notifications tab)?
Slack,1,0,@iPhonyMC A dark theme is something we're considering, but it isn't on our immediate roadmap. Thanks for suggesting it! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@ninamohanty  😍
Slack,1,0,@PavelLipcean There's a maximum limit of 10 integrations on the free plan. 🤖 Check out the details here: https://t.co/GF6g2102ev
Slack,1,0,@PavelLipcean Hi Pavel! Happy 4th of July to you too! Ah, that warning message indicates that your team is on the free plan.
Slack,0,0,@iansu Hey, thanks for the feedback, friend! We'll share it with our iOS team.
Slack,0,0,@ReneeSzostak Ah! We tend to use the Do Not Disturb feature to make sure that doesn't happen, but we'll give it some thought! Thanks! ✨
Slack,0,0,@celinasays Oh dear! If you try holding Shift+Esc, does that clear it by any chance?
Slack,1,0,@Omega_ Ah! Thank you for clarifying this for us. We will make note of this for the team. Thanks again, Alexander! 🐝 📝
Slack,0,0,@wagnerbeethoven We hear you, Wagner. We also appreciate your kindness and patience. Hopefully we can resolve this for you soon. Thanks! 🙌
Slack,0,0,@Omega_ 🤔 Currently, you can set a retention policy to "destroy" messages. We're thinking about Read Receipts, but nothing to report yet.🌟
Slack,0,0,@citrusui Sorry for the troubles here. Have you tried periodically quitting and re-launching the app? That will often help.
Slack,1,0,@OmarReiss Noted! Thank you for the feedback. 🙏
Slack,0,0,@wagnerbeethoven You can maybe try going to Preferences > Advanced, scroll down to “Debugging Options,” check “Disable local storage."
Slack,0,0,@wagnerbeethoven 😓  Our team is working on bettering this issue. We really appreciate your patience in the interim. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@areyoufried Ah! In that case, since you have admin status, this means the team is set to allow only Owners to approve those requests.
Slack,0,0,@StrayPixel We'll look into this. Thanks! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@StrayPixel Apologies, Elijah. We see that you're in! Sorry for the confusion.  🙏
Slack,0,0,@StrayPixel Hey, Elijah. Can you connect with a Team Owner or Admin, and have them turn off your 2FA from here: https://t.co/OQ556Ikstg
Slack,0,0,@hedgeb Anytime! 🙌
Slack,0,0,@StrayPixel Sorry to hear there's trouble signing in! After giving it a short period of time, are you able to login once again?
Slack,0,0,@hedgeb Merging could get confusing for channel history, but import and export options might help!  https://t.co/QZrfMTb7Mw
Slack,0,0,@pegasusepsilon ...https://t.co/WeWXcwsZIU so we can investigate right away? Thanks 2/2
Slack,0,0,@pegasusepsilon That is definitely not something that should be happening at all. Can you please let us know what you're seeing at... 1/2
Slack,0,0,@areyoufried We'd recommend getting in touch with one of your team's admins or owners, as they should be able to look into this for you.
Slack,7,1,@johnnyrodgersis We're so glad you're back! And we're so thrilled with your newest addition! 💖👶
Slack,0,0,@RemkoWeijnen Interesting! We don't have auto-threading, but our own team uses emoji like ✅ to sign off on completed items— could that work?
Slack,0,0,@philipamour Nope! As long as you stick to "Clear cache and restart" rather than "Reset app data" you should be good to go 👍
Slack,1,0,@OmarReiss We hear you! That's definitely a thoughtful idea. We'll give it some thought! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@philipamour Thanks! Have you tried clearing the cache from the Help menu in the MacOS menu bar yet? We've got our fingers crossed!
Slack,0,0,@ohcibi Sorry, not sure we follow! We've always allowed up to 5 single channel guests per regular member for paid teams.
Slack,1,0,@RLerallut We don't fool around when it comes to cheese. 🧀
Slack,1,0,@wizonesolutions Via feedback https://t.co/WeWXcwsZIU would be best so we can get the right folks on the case ASAP. Sorry for the trouble!
Slack,0,0,@philipamour That definitely doesn't seem like the expected behavior! Can we ask which version of the client you're on at the moment? 🙇
Slack,0,0,@jchiarav  Le hemos respondido al correo electrónico que nos envió. Si tiene alguna pregunta adicional, ¡no dude en contactarnos de nuevo :)
Slack,0,0,@galenking No problem :) You would indeed need to update the integration with new projects, yes!
Slack,0,0,@IrregularExpr Excellent 😊 Do keep us posted and sorry again for the trouble!
Slack,0,0,@IrregularExpr This is a known bug we're working on at present. Apologies for the trouble! Does a reload via Ctrl + R help for now?
Slack,0,0,@galenking You have to manually select them for now, sorry about that!
Slack,1,0,@Aly_Jwd That's no problem at all and thanks for the kind words :)
Slack,0,1,@Aly_Jwd We will of course share it with them and we appreciate your honest thoughts 🙏 Thank you!

Slack,0,0,@Aly_Jwd We are very grateful for your feedback and always carefully consider this. We can certainly share your thoughts with the team 1/2
Slack,0,0,@petemorrisios This is a known bug then we're afraid. You should see improvements in the next version so we hope you can bear with us 🙏😊
Slack,0,0,@wizonesolutions Sure! Could you please contact /feedback so we can provide some troubleshooting steps? We just need more room, apologies!
Slack,0,0,@Aly_Jwd Sorry about that, we changed the UI a while ago. Could you drop a link to the new channel in general instead so people can join up?
Slack,0,0,@petemorrisios By any chance do you end up manually cancelling that download as a result of it not working, or does it crash regardless?
Slack,0,0,@ceo_or_bust Very strange, thanks for sharing! Could you please reach out to feedback@slack.com so we can dig further for you? Thanks!
Slack,0,0,@moskoben Thanks for reporting, we'll look into it!

Slack,0,0,@moskoben 🤔 Interesting! Is it a custom emoji in between the two pray emojis?
Slack,0,0,@vasuvasu If on a Mac, it's intentional! The microphone is behind one speaker, so sound comes from the other so there's no feedback loops. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@DavidBoike  🙌
Slack,1,0,@leafbelly So sorry about that, private channels can only be archived. https://t.co/KVmAxWYKdF
Slack,0,0,@DavidBoike Well Heck. Could you please write in with screenshots in that case? feedback@slack.com
Slack,0,0,@sikachu You can, however you would also have to turn off All Unreads as well.
Slack,0,0,@TGTutoring Thanks for letting us know! We'll pass this on.
Slack,0,0,@DavidBoike So sorry! Could you please try resetting your local cache on iOS? Swipe left, Settings > Advanced > Reset Local Cache
Slack,0,0,@PhABCD So sorry, but this is not something that's on our roadmap. Thanks for letting us know you'd still like to see it, however.
Slack,2,0,@myetherwallet So sorry! Our team is looking into this. Please write in with details: feedback@slack.com
Slack,0,0,@DomLuxfordly So sorry about this! What sort of problems? Feel free to write in: feedback@slack.com 🙌
Slack,0,0,@TheRealBnut Thanks for the feedback! We'll pass that along.
Slack,0,0,@PavelLipcean Ah, we get it! Maybe have a look here? https://t.co/Py2QSMrw83
Slack,0,0,@lexandermygind 👍
Slack,1,0,@worldcodename_G We have audio and video calling capability! https://t.co/gffXaPTWde
Slack,0,0,@iankent Hm. Could you write in so we can have a look? feedback@slack.com 🙌
Slack,1,0,@Esquiring Turning off any extensions you have running would have been our next advice! If that doesn't reveal anything let us know!
Slack,0,0,@johnalxndr The team is considering the best way forward for this, and thanks for letting us know you'd like to see it.
Slack,0,0,@iankent Thanks for the kind words! Could you tell us where you see the URL identifier? feedback@slack.com
Slack,0,0,@UltraSub Thanks for the feedback. Nothing as such, but well make a note of it!
Slack,0,0,@Esquiring  Oh dear. Does a refresh solve things? Could you tell us if you see this in a browser or a desktop app?
Slack,0,0,@jacobbednarz There should not be! If you are having issues, could you write in? feedback@slack.com
Slack,0,0,@kelleyshine Oh no! Could you try quitting Slack, unpinning it, then launching and pinning again?
Slack,1,0,@mathieudelvaux Oh dear, sorry about that! Could you write in so we can investigate? feedback@slack.com
Slack,0,0,@mangicrypto Would you please email details about this to feedback@slack.com?
Slack,0,0,@riking27 Sorry for the trouble! Please write to feedback@slack.com and we'll help with this.
Slack,0,0,@robertedwards There isn't, sorry. Though you can use "3 July 2017" when setting a reminder.
Slack,0,0,@AsheshAmbasta No, we're not aware of anything like that. Would you please write to feedback@slack.com so we can get more information?
Slack,0,0,@Skyekm Very sorry about the trouble. We had a brief issue that should be fixed now.
Slack,0,0,@Idyilere That site isn't ours so we wouldn't be able to help with it, sorry.
Slack,0,0,@bkastl Sorry, we don't have a timeline we can share. We're working on it though!
Slack,0,0,@Idyilere Where exactly are you seeing that error? In the Slack app?
Slack,1,0,@RenoInMO We'll let the team know that's an option you'd like to see! Thanks for the suggestion.
Slack,0,0,@mdonatas Our Windows desktop app does have a notifications badge on the taskbar icon. What else would you like to see?
Slack,0,0,@bennimack Those can be edited here: https://t.co/jNDAh7Aml5
Slack,0,0,@ka_piva In that case please send screenshots over to feedback@slack.com with the team's details. We'll look into this.
Slack,0,0,@criscmaia Sorry about that, it's not available through the API. Time zones are set on an individual user basis.
Slack,1,0,@beeman_nl We'll do our best, and thank you for the feedback!
Slack,0,0,@bennimack Not sure what you're looking to do exactly. Mine elaborating? You want to edit your permitted signup email domains?
Slack,0,0,@chantilli We're seeing a bit of a hiccup with posts right now. We're working on it, sorry for the disruption for now. 😓
Slack,6,0,@Fillerin0 Not at the moment, but we'll make a note of it as something to think about! 💭
Slack,1,0,@gytdau Huh. So it doesn't! We'll see about getting that looked into. 🤓
Slack,0,0,@ka_piva Oh! You're saying you have two different pictures? Is it possible you're signing into a different team on mobile vs desktop?
Slack,0,0,@JamesMunnelly It's that way right now for security's sake: each team admin configures their own preferred security settings. 🔐
Slack,0,0,@visa_interview Sadly, no. But you can set that channel as a default one in your admin settings. Then, everyone is in as soon as they join.
Slack,0,0,@bluedonkey Interesting! Let us share that with the team. 💸
Slack,0,0,@robv23 👋 Thanks for the check-in! It's still on our radar.
Slack,1,0,@SandyMazza Fair enough! Like anything, they're customizable, so you can remove them from your team and replace the… https://t.co/vJjtpLKDyH
Slack,0,0,@jannylund Thanks for the feedback. We'll let the team here know you'd like to see this feature added! 📝
Slack,0,0,@enshrined Hmmm, is this happening in the Slack app? Have you tried clearing the cache to see if that resolves the issue? Let us know!
Slack,0,0,@megmischler Oh dear! We're praying you won't be lonely for too long! 🙏
Slack,1,0,@ashleymarinep Possibly! We'll certainly let the team know it's a feature you'd love to see down the line. 🔮 Thanks!
Slack,0,0,@riddle 2/2..., we recommend manually uploading files using the [+] icon to avoid crashing behavior. Thanks for bearing with us on this one.
Slack,0,0,@riddle We're hoping to have this fixed as soon as possible, so sorry again for the wait. In the meantime...1/2
Slack,0,0,@pcamp96 Sounds like a possible bug with iOS notifications. Mind dropping us a line to feedback@slack.com so we can investigate further? 🕵️
Slack,0,0,@ka_piva It's not possible unfortunately, they're synced across platforms!
Slack,1,0,@TweetsOfSumit It's a custom response added by your team mates! You can add them here: https://t.co/ZzUBtgNUjL
Slack,0,0,@artismarti We still don't have an ETA on this, so sorry for the annoyance. Thanks for bearing with us 🙏
Slack,0,0,@add_action_dan can we take a look into this with you? Our email is feedback@slack.com
Slack,0,0,@add_action_dan Oh no, what are you seeing when you try to log in?
Slack,0,0,@whereismeersman 🦋🌸🌳🌼🌈
Slack,0,0,@lmrz 🙌
Slack,0,0,@visa_interview Alas, no. Slash commands can only be triggered by human messages directly from Slack! 🤖🎈
Slack,0,0,@ixisit We’ll pass the feedback along to our team. 🌸
Slack,0,0,@dalman If you could please drop us a line at feedback@slack.com we'll have one of the specialists take a look for you! 🙏
Slack,0,0,@lmrz @anthonysterling Hmm, that sounds a bit odd — mind writing to feedback@slack.com so we can dig into this for you?
Slack,0,0,@codeOfRobin @meghafon Eep! Is this happening on the latest version (v2.6.2)? Can you see if Help > Clear Cache and Restart helps please?
Slack,0,0,@meghafon Oh dear! What version does this happen on for you? Also, do you find Help > Clear Cache and Restart makes a difference?
Slack,0,0,@TimDierckxsens Thank you, we'll have one of our specialists investigate!
Slack,0,0,@BaggySEO Ah, we see what you mean! Hmm, if you don't mind dropping a line to feedback@slack.com, we can take a closer look at it. 🙏
Slack,6,0,@lukas81298 @alex_persian https://t.co/9lyS56AOvL
Slack,0,0,@TimDierckxsens That doesn’t sound good, Tim. Please write to us at feedback@slack.com and we’ll get someone to take a look right away.
Slack,0,0,@ixisit We hear you, and we'll look into how we can improve it. If you're feeling handy, you could cook something up using our API!
Slack,1,0,@psilfver We don't support file uploads in Threads yet, but we're working on it!
Slack,0,0,@ixisit The quickest way is to ask your team to delete their own unused files at: https://t.co/7NUNu6dTjS.
Slack,0,0,@PlanetWideCity Our stickers are available at: https://t.co/7dwfFrROwJ 🙌
Slack,0,0,@greymurmurs 🙌
Slack,0,0,@greymurmurs Hi! Sorry, we don't support custom domains in Slack. The domain has to be: [teamname].slack.com
Slack,1,0,@lz650sss We'll need to have a closer look at what's going wrong. Do you mind writing in to us at feedback@slack.com? 🙏
Slack,0,0,@BaggySEO Timezones are set at account-level and can be changed at: https://t.co/hODkgz6M8K. Is there something amiss in your team's stats?
Slack,0,0,@anthonysterling That's interesting! 🤔 We'll share that thought with the team here. 📞
Slack,0,0,@robertsammons We're long overdue on this front! It's on our list, hang in there. 😊
Slack,0,0,@DKatri Nothing unusual from our side right now! Thanks for reporting though. Can we take a deeper look? Our email is feedback@slack.com
Slack,1,0,@MelWas Thanks very much, Mel 🙇
Slack,0,0,@BabyAzerty Thanks very much!
Slack,0,0,@dalman Oh no! Sorry about that. Which mobile app are you using?
Slack,0,0,@BabyAzerty Sorry about that! Do you mind dropping us a line to feedback@slack.com about this?
Slack,1,0,@MelWas Oh dear! Sorry about that. Do you mind writing in? We'll take a look: https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,1,0,@MelWas If you go into a direct message, you'll see a star you can click under the team member's name at the top.
Slack,0,0,@MelWas We keep only recent conversations visible to prevent clutter. You can star a conversation to have it shown permanently, though!
Slack,1,1,@tobiasgies We often recommend giving bots their own channel, which can be left or muted etc.
Slack,0,0,@looptrader We're looking into the situation as we speak. Do drop us a line if your team is seeing issues: https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,0,0,@cookstaar Because people might have shared on the understanding of a degree of privacy.
Slack,1,0,@lurexus Oh crikey — that's a good point. Meantime, you could give them nice distinct themes? (Preferences > Sidebar theme)
Slack,4,0,@mattparkins @alex_persian Since you put it like that, Matt, how could we have gone with anything else? (Btw, your name is upside down)
Slack,0,0,@lz650sss Sorry about that! Which app or browser are you using?
Slack,0,0,@rrosen84 Sorry about that! Would you mind sending us details so we can try to reproduce this? https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,2,0,@TSigberg We can pass along to the team that you'd like to see this changed 🙌
Slack,0,0,@TSigberg Private channels evolved from early group conversations, which it didn't make sense to delete. Not the best reason, sorry…
Slack,1,0,@stevenlangbroek Neat idea! Thanks for sharing 📌
Slack,1,0,@taka_dhu No trouble at all — thank you! ❣️
Slack,0,0,@HenrikRikuto We're so glad! 🎈🎉🤣🌂🎡🍱🌞⌚️
Slack,1,0,@lurexus We've no plans for this, but it's an interesting idea — thanks! 📝✨
Slack,1,0,@MussarMusic Thanks, friend! We'll get on it ASAP. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@joemellin Well if you have to ask... 🤔 Anyway, do you mind dropping a few more details to https://t.co/WeWXcwsZIU? Will take a closer look!
Slack,0,0,@samjarman You can't perform admin actions on primary owners, but drop us a note at https://t.co/WeWXcwsZIU and we'll have suggestions. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@bugfroggy Hmm, things look peachy from our end. 🤔 If you're still seeing this error, please drop us a note: https://t.co/WeWXcwsZIU 🔍
Slack,0,0,@acblet Oh no! 😓 Bring them all up with '/remind list' —  maybe there's some you can delete? 📝☕️
Slack,0,0,@PavelLipcean There should be place for it when a team members edit their profile. 🤔 Are you seeing something else?
Slack,1,0,@MussarMusic 👋 Please drop us a note, we'll take a look: https://t.co/WeWXcwsZIU 💌
Slack,0,0,@hebinotoshi No option currently, sorry. 😔 But more customizable options for reminders is on our radar. 📝 Thanks for sharing! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@bscht No keyboard shortcuts?! 😱 Could you please write in so we can take a closer look? https://t.co/WeWXcwsZIU
Slack,0,0,@oliverbenns Oof. Sorry, Oliver. 😓 We're working on reducing Slack's footprint. Please bear with us. 🚧
Slack,0,0,@jeffweisbein Yikes! Apologies, Jeff! Please drop us a note so we can get you back online: feedback@slack.com ⚡️
Slack,0,0,@taka_dhu Oh boy, that's strange! Does your time zone look correct? 👉 Click your team name, then Preferences > Language & Region.
Slack,0,0,@Dan17894652 Hmm, the folks in the Melbourne office tell us it could also mean 'smart casual trousers'. Interesting! 🤔💭👖
Slack,0,0,@mons00n It can take up to 24 hours to see the change reflected on the statistics page. Please hang tight! 🏄
Slack,0,0,@BrianKFrancis Oh, lovely! 🙌 Let us know if there's anything else we can give you a hand with. 🎈
Slack,0,0,@jeffweisbein 😬Uh-oh, we're sorry for the trouble. Are you using Slack in a browser or a desktop app? Can you connect in Chrome Incognito?
Slack,2,0,@SQLRockstar Hi there, we're sorry this isn't your preference. You're not alone with this request, and we'll note the continued interest ✍😄
Slack,15,1,@alex_persian We knew we had to limit reactions to avoid clutter and encourage creativity, and 23 seemed like a nice prime number.¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Slack,0,0,@_RGT12_ Very kind of you to say so! 🐝
Slack,0,0,@BrianKFrancis Oh no! We'd like to look into this further - can you drop us a line at feedback@slack.com? 📝👀
Slack,1,0,@_RGT12_ We hear you! In fact, this is something we're looking to improve in the future. 🔮
Slack,0,0,@mattcen Hello! Anything we can help with?
Slack,2,0,@JSn1nj4 We hear you — thanks for the feedback 🙇
Slack,1,0,@JohnRichDesign 📝🙌
Slack,0,0,@apiousman 🤣 (and yes!)
Slack,0,0,@kersten_broich That's so good to hear — thanks!
Slack,0,0,@apiousman We've no ETA to share just yet, but we're working on it 🙌
Slack,0,0,@OhNoItsFusl But we've shared your feedback with the team — sorry again for the annoyance 🙌
Slack,0,0,@OhNoItsFusl We're really sorry for the frustration. We're now showing some info sooner rather than waiting longer to show all of it.
Slack,1,0,@nabinno Sorry about that! Do you mind dropping us a line about this? https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,1,0,@noboundsdigital More info: https://t.co/ZpsIvgDWDo
Slack,1,0,@noboundsdigital Btw, you can choose what channels are imported at the import stage.
Slack,0,0,@petebocken Sorry about that! We'll let the team know this is something you'd like. Thanks 🙌
Slack,2,0,@bikehugger @mathowie You should see what he can do on a penny-farthing…
Slack,0,0,@KhayaMaloney Sorry for the frustration! Heavy in what way?
Slack,1,0,@ryaneshea Thanks so much for flagging this. Please write in with details if you haven't already: https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,0,0,@86era Sorry about that! Do you mind writing in so we can explore this in more detail? https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,0,0,@melomap We retired the web archive view — sorry for any confusion. Archives should be viewable in-app, though!
Slack,0,0,@robyn_ravenclaw You should be able to share a link to a GIF and have it display in channel — does that help?
Slack,0,0,@char_fish We'd like to investigate this further. Would you mind writing us at feedback@slack.com? Thanks!
Slack,1,0,@noboundsdigital We hear you, Ben. We're looking to improve this process. If you hit any walls, email us at feedback@slack.com.
Slack,0,0,@w00tyLab  We don't have this option just yet! Sorry about that. We are working to make improvements in this area! 🙏
Slack,1,0,@chadsipes  Sensible idea! We'll pass it along. 👌
Slack,5,0,@darcylou  Oh dear! We are investigating this bug as we speak. Thank you for your patience and sorry for the scare. 👻
Slack,1,0,@octal Ah! We see what you mean. We’ll pass the idea along! ⭐
Slack,3,0,@OtyMartin 😎 We hear you, Martin! Your feedback has been duly noted. 📝
Slack,0,0,@HeatherSmithAU Yup! For security reasons, you will have to sign into all teams.
Slack,0,0,@andymadge If any were directed to Private Channels, you will have to re-create them. 😬
Slack,0,0,@andymadge As an Admin/Owner, you should be able to re-enable any integrations pointing to Public Channels here: https://t.co/ZpLTzsB134
Slack,1,0,@TheTannerRyan @kilodelta You sure can! Just visit our Slack Shop: https://t.co/vhPGzZ7F7D 🙌
Slack,0,0,@86era 🤔 Hmm. Does it work for you in other apps? Can you also try powering down and then restarting. Thanks!
Slack,1,0,@octal Sure thing! Tell us more about what you mean when you say 'locking down a channel,' and we'll see if there's anything to suggest. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@NotBabafemi We hear you, Femi. We'll relay this feedback to the team for you. Thanks for sharing! 🙌
Slack,0,0,@tennyson1842 Possibly! We'd love to take a closer look, just in case. Can you drop us a line at feedback@slack.com. Thank you, Michael! 👀🔍
Slack,1,0,@duellsy Many, many little Slack helpers! 👩🏻‍💻👨🏻‍💻👩🏾‍💻👨🏿‍💻👩‍💻👨‍💻
Slack,1,0,@benhaynes That's certainly an idea! We aren't currently planning on this, but it's food for thought. Thanks!
Slack,1,0,@idftech Hey thanks! 😘
Slack,0,0,@tennyson1842 Oh no! Can we ask which browser you are using? If you try an incognito or private browser, does that work?
Slack,0,0,@tennyson1842 Can you try this help test, and send us the results when it's finished? https://t.co/X1Uo3T8GP5
Slack,0,0,@tennyson1842 Oh dear! We're not seeing troubles on our side: are you getting an error message you could share with us?
Slack,0,0,@lelandf Hmmm, do you have more than 1 team signed in? Could there be an unread DM or mention in a secondary team perchance?
Slack,0,0,@duncanjeremy Sadly, that is an ongoing issue the team is working on. So sorry for the inconvenience! 🙌
Slack,0,0,@caolantweets Sorry for the bad news there 😞  We'll share your feedback with our team to give more thought to.
Slack,0,0,@ultimape Oh dear, that looks like a reminder set by one of the users on your team. Please contact your team admin and let them know!
Slack,0,0,@jedahan You can always send through a note to our team via https://t.co/WeWXcwsZIU when you have a chance, and our team will dig in! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@mittense Ooh we see what you mean. We've heard some folks have tried remapping their Esc key— is that something you've tried at all?
Slack,1,0,@Kraft @Folletto Yup! Electron is the base we use for the Windows, Mac, and Linux client ✨
Slack,1,0,@jamiefeedback We see what you mean and we'll be happy to pass this on. 💖
Slack,0,0,@caolantweets We recently retired the message archives. We can seamlessly load links now directly in the app.
Slack,0,0,@mittense Yes indeed! You can use `Shift+esc` to mark all channels in a team as read.
Slack,1,0,@icastanheda It is! Tap the message you'd like to reply to, and type a reply. 📱
Slack,0,0,@jedahan Where are you seeing a mandatory field like that? Could you send a screenshot?
Slack,0,0,@mikejimlarry No, that's not possible, sorry.
Slack,0,0,@sarahhalle Campaign? Are we running for election? No one told us! We should probably go by suits.
Slack,0,0,@erinlauraoneil 🤔 Please write to feedback@slack.com with the team details so we can take a closer look into this.
Slack,0,0,@OhNoItsFusl We're very sorry. We're working to speed thing up so all information in a channel loads more quickly.
Slack,0,0,@calebsboyd Thanks!
Slack,1,0,@crouhana We're afraid it's not possible to do so at this time; sorry for any inconvenience this causes!
Slack,0,0,@TylerJBunnell ...apologies! Our team is aware of it and working on this issue 🙏 2/2
Slack,0,0,@TylerJBunnell Ah, gotcha. We do have a known issue where calls use discrete, and the app doesn't switch after the call ends. Our... 1/2
Slack,0,0,@TylerJBunnell Sorry about this, Tyler! Is this after placing a call in Slack by chance?
Slack,0,0,@calebsboyd Could you send your team details and some specific example URLs to feedback@slack.com? We'll take a closer look into this.
Slack,0,0,@thats_so_neil Oh no! What a jumbled up way to start your weekend. Can you try refreshing (Cmd + R) to see if that helps?
Slack,0,0,@icywolfy We're terribly sorry for the frustrating experience. Does Ctrl + R or Cmd + R help at all?
Slack,2,0,@SeanJA 👋 With a quick refresh, this should be fixed! And thank goodness, it was driving our writers up a wall.
Slack,0,0,@mybeachisbetter Ah! Please drop us a note so we can see what might be possible. feedback@slack.com 🙌
Slack,1,0,@pmenonb  😔  You're running into a bug that our team is working to tackle. Deleting and then reinstalling the app should fix this for you.
Slack,1,0,@Folletto Noted. Please know we'll share this with the team over here. 👉
Slack,1,0,@houstongraham No timeline to give you yet. Perhaps we do need to reorganize our priorities 😅 . Thanks for your patience!
Slack,0,0,@ProfessorTom There isn't a way to mute a channel for a specified time. That is a very good idea though! We'll make note it for you. 📝
Slack,0,0,@hatsharpener Sorry about that! 😅 Threads within a public channel are visible to anyone on the team if they click into them.
Slack,1,0,@kenliecer ¡Gracias Kenneth! Quizás algún día. 💖
Slack,0,0,@Indie_Intern That is not ideal. 😅 Please drop a note to feedback@slack.com and we'll help you out.
Slack,0,0,@ceo_or_bust It is? Can you share a screenshot of what that looks like? We're at feedback@slack.com if you prefer.
Slack,0,0,@realdarthdoesmc The bulk delete feature no longer exists, following the removal of the message archives pages. Sorry about that. ☹️
Slack,0,0,@calebsboyd  🤔 Is it unfurling in your team despite being blacklisted, or would you like it to not unfurl for everyone's teams?
Slack,0,0,@jonathansywulak Thanks for letting us know! We'll let our Platform team know this would be a major time-saver for you. 🚀
Slack,0,0,@allhailqueenbie 👍🏿👍🏾👍🏽👍🏼👍🏻✨
Slack,0,0,@paniolo08 No, this is new to us. Could you please go to https://t.co/5gmpOHU2Rn and send the results to Support? We'll investigate!
Slack,0,0,@tyler_warnecke There’s no upper limit, but you may not have the most ideal experience with several thousand members.
Slack,0,1,@iamVP7 We don't have an all-at-once option, but we'd be happy to email you a list of all your teams: https://t.co/oUb433Gxi1 💌
Slack,0,0,@tyler_warnecke It's not possible to have just anyone join a team, but there are a few options available: https://t.co/1ypdIh3WFV.
Slack,0,0,@_siddheshM We hear you — we're working hard to get thing back to normal.
Slack,1,0,@melboyce Well spotted! Thanks, we'll let our documentation crew know. 🌟
Slack,0,0,@j0hnluke Interesting, we'll share it with the team! We don't have that, but maybe something in our App Directory?: https://t.co/tNULINngLT
Slack,1,0,@lukebrewster Thanks for the kind words, Luke! There are no firm plans for this at the moment, but this is a great suggestion.
Slack,0,0,@SirDugs Custom slash commands can be configured to send GET requests, but App commands cannot. Sorry!
Slack,1,0,@jamesleebennett It’s not currently on the roadmap, but we’ll consider it for the future. Thanks for the suggestion! 🎈
Slack,0,0,@maslowbeer Alas, no — we understand this is frustrating for you. It’s not currently on the roadmap, but we’ll consider it for the future.
Slack,0,0,@SeanJA Very strange! We'll let the team know and investigate — thanks for letting us know!
Slack,1,0,@derfleck Alas, no, it's only possible to activate it for a day at the moment — we are exploring the options, however.
Slack,0,0,@ntcoding Thank you for these thoughts — we'll pass them to the team, and look into how it can be improved!
Slack,0,0,@SeanJA Just to confirm, could you let us know where you're seeing this? Is it a timestamp for a message posted in a channel?
Slack,13,0,@Hacker0x01 🍔🍔🍔
Slack,0,0,@SirDugs Ah, we get you now! App icons need to be squares, so that seems to be the problem with your image.
Slack,0,0,@ntcoding We're sorry it's not working for you at the moment, but we're taking all feedback on board. What seems to be the problem?
Slack,0,0,@SirDugs Strange! What exactly are you seeing when you try to upload it, and what app and version are you using?
Slack,0,0,@SeanJA Oops, thanks for flagging this to us Sean! 🙈
Slack,1,0,@hersh_amin Ah, we hear you. It’s not currently on the roadmap, but we’ll consider this for the future.
Slack,0,0,@j0hnluke Hmm, do you mean inspirational loading messages, or just daily inspirational messages for your team?
Slack,0,0,@aleximj Hmm, you should be able to! What seems to be happening for you? 🤔
Slack,1,0,@hersh_amin Is there anything in particular that is causing problems?
Slack,1,0,@DomStich That's it! A gentle tap. 😄
Slack,1,0,@DomStich You can start a thread following these steps: tap on the message, then tap on Start a thread and press return. 🙌
Slack,1,0,@dblencowe Oh, sorry for the trouble! Do you mind writing us a report at https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X? 🙏
Slack,0,0,@juter Sorry about that Justin! Do you mind sending us a report using the slash command /feedback? Our team will look into this. 🙏
Slack,0,0,@P_BrianMackey Ah excellent! Glad to hear we found a solution. 🙌
Slack,0,0,@sfhosley We'll certainly relay that feedback to the team for you :)
Slack,0,0,@thomasdegry Thanks so much - we will take a look into it more closely for you now.
Slack,0,0,@thomasdegry Could you please try this test and forward the results to /feedback: https://t.co/fHDQCFxYhG we will dig further! Thanks 2/2
Slack,0,0,@thomasdegry It shouldn't cause any problems that you're connecting from Europe. 1/2
Slack,0,0,@thomasdegry We've not had other reports of this thus far. Are others on your network experiencing the same issue?
Slack,0,0,@Js41637 We pull this from the page's meta data. Might be good feedback for that site? 📜
Slack,0,0,@seanjreilly The bug has remained open and no full fix has been confirmed just yet but do bear with us and will get this done asap! 🙏
Slack,0,0,@danjessen Great, thanks for keeping us posted and do let us know if you have further trouble. 🙏
Slack,1,0,@Foxandxss Sorry for this trouble. That's due to a bug we're currently investigating and working to resolve. We hope you can bear with us 🙏
Slack,0,0,@danjessen Then let us know if you see any improvements there? Thanks so much and sorry again! 2/2
Slack,0,0,@danjessen It should but we had some issue with it in recent updates, Apologies. Can you try the latest version  https://t.co/S1sb16v6dA 1/2
Slack,0,0,@danjessen Sorry for all this trouble. Could you please go to help > show logs in finder and forward them to /feedback so we can look? 🙏
Slack,0,0,@anupriyako If so, would you mind dropping us a line? https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,0,0,@anupriyako Sorry about that! Do you still see this if you refresh your team with Ctrl/Cmd R?
Slack,0,1,@bscht Afraid this bug is still ongoing 😏 So sorry about that, we hope to have it resolved very soon. Thanks for bearing with us 🤗
Slack,0,0,@seanjreilly Sorry about that! This is a known issue — but thanks for the nudge 🙌
Slack,0,0,@danjessen Hmm, can you please restart the app by pressing Cmd + Q and then reopen Slack. Let me know if that brings them back for you! 🤞
Slack,0,0,@martinbeentjes 2/2...on your team use them. We'll share your message as a feature request with the team in charge of custom statuses. ✍️
Slack,0,0,@martinbeentjes We did consider animated emojis for status updates but we decided that it could be very distracting if lots of users...1/2
Slack,0,0,@tariqrauf Thanks for the feedback! We'll pass it along to the team here for consideration down the line 🤞
Slack,0,0,@lexandermygind Great, thank you! Can you also please confirm if it works ok for them in a browser?
Slack,0,0,@domurtag Hmmm sorry about this. Would you mind writing to us at feedback@slack.com so that we can investigate this issue further? Thanks! 🙏
Slack,1,0,@lexandermygind Is this happening on Mac or Windows? Can they check that they are on the latest version of the app: https://t.co/RvUnYTicJJ
Slack,1,0,@OddChirp Hey! Thanks for taking time out to report it. You can send details to feedback@slack.com. 🙇🏻‍♀️
Slack,0,0,@ShajanSheriff Hmm, that seems strange. Mind writing in to feedback@slack.com so we can take a closer look?
Slack,0,0,@sarahspoon 🙌
Slack,0,0,@WorcsWebStudio Sadly, we don't have a way to bulk delete messages at the moment. We are all ears for feedback on this change.👂
Slack,0,0,@EthanSzcz1 🙌🌸
Slack,0,0,@lexandermygind Eep, what seems to be happening for them?
Slack,1,0,@avizuber Nothing wrong with it at all, it's perfectly good! It was unrelated inadvisable googling that lead to 😑.
Slack,0,0,@xSaplingIV 😨🙉🤗💖
Slack,5,1,@desantis @jk_rowling @nickabouzeid Surely there are some levitating businessmen working in the Ministry of Magic, no?
Slack,1,0,@soniagupta504 Not this time. ✨
Slack,1,0,@kyletothejones One little spoiler, and then we'll be done:

The sun comes up. 👯
Slack,1,0,@netweb Nice! Happy Open Source Friday!
Slack,9,1,@nickabouzeid @desantis  We just realized that Webdings is 20 years old. So is Harry Potter! Coincidence? 🤔🤔🤔
Slack,0,0,@peterchaly Oh, we're on the lookout. 😼
Slack,1,0,@mittense Sorry about that, and thanks for the report! We'll look into it. (We think we see the issue.)
Slack,1,0,@makerspherehq That's an overload of cuteness! 🙈🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱🐱
Slack,0,0,@ShajanSheriff Hm, sorry about this. What macOS and Slack app is this occurring on?
Slack,0,0,@jvusa You've done all the hard work, the least we can do is give you a tractor?! 😉✨🚜
Slack,3,1,@desantis ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Slack,0,0,@emily_kellert 😍✌️💖🌍
Slack,1,0,@MiraDarkblood 🐋🌊🏄🌊🌊🌊🐙🌊🌊🚣🌊🌊
Slack,5,1,@purana We have offices in alllllll the capital cities of Victoria. Including this one.
Slack,1,0,@makerspherehq ... and 🐶? 😽
Slack,0,0,@Bizzycola3 All except this tiny duckling. The duckling knows what's up. https://t.co/eVa56t5bps
Slack,8,0,@Bizzycola3 We tried that one and just got a gif of a cat on a Roomba.
Slack,6,0,@joebe4rd What's the phobia you didn't know you had until you searched for it to find out what it was? It's that one.
Slack,1,0,@helloawestrich What a great way to spend your Saturday! 🕹 Enjoy the weekend!
Slack,2,0,@dloehr 🎈✨🏂💖🍩🎵
Slack,1,0,@maxinelines 😘🐰
Slack,62,3,Retraction: our emoji of the day just changed to 😑 after a regrettable Google search. We apologize for the error.
Slack,54,3,In SlackHQ Melbourne today, our emoji of the day is 🕴. Yours?

(PS — Hi! Happy Friday!)
Slack,0,0,@SavingPrincess We hear ya! There's no firm plans, but we'll keep your use case in mind!
Slack,0,0,@sfhosley Ah, we recently replaced the progress bar with the spinner. Thanks for letting us know — we'll share your messages with the team.
Slack,0,0,@0x71 As much as we'd love some extra cash, we're afraid we currently have no plans to increase this limit. Sorry!
Slack,0,0,@benwdwd Afraid we don't support consolidated logins across teams for security & administrative reasons. Sorry for the frustration!
Slack,1,0,@aaronorosen We hear you! No ETA, but we're exploring both image/file threads. We'll let the team know you're keen!
Slack,0,0,@jay_peg Hmm, 🤔 that's quite strange, sorry! Would you mind writing in? We'd love to dig into this further with you. https://t.co/KsR6mZY2hf
Slack,0,0,@JohnZimmerman Lucky we didn't write it down in pen. 😅 Note amended! 📝
Slack,0,0,@chrislorensson ✨🏄🎈
Slack,2,0,@keranm @girlie_mac Oh, yay! We're glad you two met up after all! 🍿
Slack,0,0,@sfhosley (You can check that by swiping left in Slack > Settings > About.)
Slack,0,0,@sfhosley We received a few similar reports a while back, but we believe this issue to be fixed. Which version of Slack for iOS are you on?
Slack,0,0,@sfhosley Got it. Are you using the Slack desktop app, or web browser? Mac or Windows? If you're accessing Slack via browser, which one?
Slack,0,0,@mattbettinson 😂 😇
Slack,0,0,@sfhosley Oh, that's unusual. There should actually be a progress bar along the top of the channel. Do you see a green bar along the top?
Slack,0,0,@B_Meson Thanks so much! 🙇🏻
Slack,0,0,@B_Meson Okay! Could you please update to our latest version, 2.6.3, from https://t.co/GCw7YxxgIh? We have a feeling this will fix things!
Slack,4,0,@dubstrike You are ever-so-welcome.
Slack,0,0,@brenolf_ Sorry, we don't have any updates on this particular feature. It's not currently prioritized on our roadmap, we're afraid. 🤕
Slack,2,1,@TheClaudacity We hear carrier pigeons were all the rage. 🐦
Slack,0,0,@JohnZimmerman Noted! We agree, that would be a helpful addition. 📝
Slack,0,0,@jay_peg 😓 Ah, Mac or Windows? Slack *should* open links in your computer's default browser. You changed this at the system level, correct?
Slack,0,0,@B_Meson Yikes. Are you on the Mac or Windows app? Does the font size change permanently, or is it a temporary thing?
Slack,0,0,@sfhosley Ow, sorry about that! You're noticing that it's taking a while to load your status when you change it, yes?
Slack,0,0,@cdiersing Oh! Like, as in, emoji reaction? You can add custom emoji from https://t.co/VwJXlFZv8s, then you can react with that emoji. 😉
Slack,1,0,@GetSlingshot Nice idea! For now, you can paste the hex codes into your internal DM, then click the button to apply them quickly. 🎨
Slack,0,0,@hksperl Hmmmm! Could any of these be the app you're looking for? https://t.co/EUNbOKJYQj 😅
Slack,0,0,@G33kyGills Oh no! Are you missing notifications on your watch? Or is the entire interface not working anymore?
Slack,0,0,@cinnabar3 Oh, afraid not. If it's being used in a specific unhelpful manner, you might try talking to your team and your admins about it!
Slack,3,0,@anildash 😅👋✨
Slack,0,0,@willcharczuk Oh, uploaded .webm files should auto-expand like you'd expect, but properly unfurling .webm links are also on our list! 🎉
Slack,0,0,@gauravphoenix Well, drat. In that case, would you be able to drop feedback@slack.com a line so we can dig deeper into what's going wrong? 💌
Slack,0,0,@B_Meson Hrmm, odd. Is that happening in both a browser and one of our desktop apps? Does it change size while you have the channel open? 🤔
Slack,0,0,@ryanvarick Right! Makes sense to us. ✨📣
Slack,0,0,@rmgenson Oh, no, sorry to say that's a known issue with the app, Rachael. It's on our radar, though, and we're hoping to fix it up soon! 🐛
Slack,0,0,@vyscond We’re exploring this idea, so stay tuned! 🎶
Slack,0,0,@billhelm  Sorry for the trouble! It’s not currently on the roadmap, but we’ll consider it for the future. Thanks for the suggestion! 🙏
Slack,1,0,@schultetonya  You’re making us blush! 😍
Slack,2,0,@adriana_howell  Cheers! 🍹🙌
Slack,0,0,@vykromond We've made some changes to how archives are launched, but the links should work in your browser from IRC.
Slack,0,0,@evolvability A team admin can turn on the "shuffle" feature for Giphy. That way you can decline to post gifs you don't like.
Slack,0,0,@kirabug That's no good! Please get in touch at feedback@slack.com and our iOS team will take a look.
Slack,0,0,@gauravphoenix 🤔 Can you try refreshing the app and see if you get the same result?
Slack,1,0,@agisilaosts We're sorry for the trouble. Better offline, low-bandwidth, and intermittent connection support are all planned.
Slack,0,0,@ryanvarick Sorry, not sure we understand. You want different preferences for DM notifications than you have for channels?
Slack,0,0,@topikito  Also, you can disable rich media in Preferences > Messages & Media > Inline Messages & Links.
Slack,0,0,@topikito We have another tip to share! Try typing /collapse to minimize animated gifs and rich media in channels. 👍
Slack,0,0,@ryanvarick Certainly! In the DM, click the Settings cog button > Notification preferences > All new messages. 👍
Slack,2,0,@DP_CyberCrime No immediate plans to change this, but thank you for the suggestion. We'll share it with the team. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@DP_CyberCrime That is the minimum length, but we recommend following this handy guide for creating safe passwords: https://t.co/xrPTvjaSkY
Slack,0,0,@vasuchawla Ah, afraid it's not possible right now, but it's a great suggestion. We'll share it with the team!
Slack,0,0,@goldiesquats Oooh. We don't have it yet, but the API is there if you're interested in building it! https://t.co/7ricUn6DcJ
Slack,1,0,@ALR42 That's an idea! 💡Thanks for sharing this with us! 👍
Slack,0,0,@erinlauraoneil 🤔 Are you trying to delete a private channel perhaps? At this time, it's only possible to archive private channels.
Slack,0,0,@sarahspoon It shouldn't, sorry. Can you go to iOS Settings > Slack > enable Reset Cache on Next Launch > let us know if a re-launch helps?
Slack,0,0,@notthatnathan Super weird. Glad to hear it's fixed, but do let us know if it happens again. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Slack,1,0,@benwiley4000 Fair! We'll pass your feedback along to the team.
Slack,1,0,@patleeman Ah gotcha! Yep, it's custom alright!
Slack,0,0,@ChrisCharabaruk We see what you mean there! Thanks for the suggestion too. We'll pass this along. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@bvhme We feel it’s important that work teams have a channel where everyone can be reached! If you like, you can mute the channel! 💡
Slack,1,0,@john_fisherman That's really good feedback! We'll look into making that better. Thanks for sharing!
Slack,0,0,@topikito 😕 We're working on improvements in this area. For now, restarting Slack may help!
Slack,0,0,@sarahspoon 😭 Which version of Slack you're using? We'll look into this.
Slack,4,0,@BenRCongdon Could be indeed 🤔. We'll pass your thoughts along!
Slack,0,0,@mattvogt Hmm… are you on Windows perhaps? There's a bug we're looking into around shift-esc at the moment.
Slack,1,0,@EricMarkDo 🌈✨
Slack,0,0,@elbutler Hmm… definitely sounds like a bug. Would you mind dropping a line to feedback@slack.com with some details?
Slack,0,0,@gmcconnaughey 💡 That's an idea! We'll give this some thought. 😃
Slack,0,0,@benwiley4000 We appreciate the feedback! If it helps at all, it also puts in a modifier limiting the search to your current channel.
Slack,1,0,@kplanz Haven't planned on it, no, but we're keeping our options open for the future. Thanks for letting us know how it's running for you! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@thenameisnat0 Ah! Yes, we're afraid that isn't going to work. Sorry about this! You'll need to contact a team Owner or Admin to join. 🎈
Slack,0,0,@AsherDeVuyst You're too kind! (We hope we're not failing too often, though!) 🌈🌲
Slack,1,0,@rafaelderolez Ah yes, that would be one of the quirks of Hangouts emoji! We're sorry that we can't make the labels match this set better.
Slack,1,0,@GroundControl They're coming! We're hoping to add the iOS 10 batch soon. Sorry about the delay! 🐙✨
Slack,0,0,@JoshAllegro Still every 5 minutes! (Is that not what you're experiencing, though? Let us know if you're having trouble!) 🍦
Slack,0,0,@Eva_CdA Thanks! We have a soft spot in our hearts for that old @playglitch forest. 🐖🌈🌲💖
Slack,0,0,@ikB3N No bribes required, just a bit of API finagling! Our blog has some basic instructions to get you started: https://t.co/l4y7jxI435
Slack,0,0,@PhillippOh 🙌
Slack,0,0,@username081 Thanks for writing in — one of our specialists is taking a look and will be in touch via email asap.
Slack,0,0,@PhillippOh Ooh, that's not ideal! If you drop us a line to feedback@slack.com we can take a closer look for you! 🙏
Slack,1,0,@laurahannawhite Alas, after the Battle of Dustball Gulch, we’re no longer allowed to have sticks at work, dusty or otherwise.
Slack,0,0,@username081 Hmm, if you drop us a line to feedback@slack.com we'll take a closer look at the situation!
Slack,0,0,@username081 From the screenshot it looks as though that's a reminder sent by someone else on the team, so your Team Owners can take action.
Slack,0,0,@FactDeJour Phew, glad to hear it! On the latest version (v2.6.3) you should also be able to use the right-click option. ✨
Slack,0,0,@NimaiMalle Ah, that's a good point. We'll definitely think about it! 🌸
Slack,0,0,@FactDeJour Oh no! What exactly are you seeing — is this using the right click menu or cmd/ctrl + v?
Slack,1,0,@adrianorbs Thanks for the suggestion — much appreciated 🙌
Slack,1,0,@JeffGlueck Sorry for the trouble! Would you mind sending us details of the problems you're seeing? https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,4,0,@HannahOmid @dens We know it's not the best experience right now, sorry! It's an Electron issue we're looking at. 🐛
Slack,0,0,@joewalshrocks Oof, not ideal! Thanks for letting us know about this — it's certainly something for us to consider.
Slack,0,0,@dtuite We hear you, and are exploring how reminders can be improved, so stay tuned! 📻
Slack,1,0,@fhendrie Gotcha. It’s not currently on the roadmap, but (for the Jensen gif) we’ll consider it for the future. ✨
Slack,0,0,@astroaware More info! https://t.co/npkXTJjKGy
Slack,0,0,@astroaware You can pin Posts to channels, and share them so they're editable by all 📝👩‍👩‍👧‍👧📌
Slack,0,0,@fhendrie Groups as in kinda sorta like folders, do you mean?
Slack,1,0,@ndxcc Cripes — sorry about that! Could you drop us a line so we can look into things? https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,0,0,@joewalshrocks Oh dear — it isn't — sorry about that! We'll note for the team that there are visual differentiation issues here.
Slack,0,0,@tdmalone But we certainly take the feedback on board. Sorry for the frustration 🙌
Slack,1,1,@tdmalone Sorry for the delay! No, it wasn't something we announced. We reason most people will want to do things in Slack…
Slack,0,0,@timjreynolds Sorry about that! Does refreshing your team with Ctrl/Cmd R help? Please drop us a line if not: https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,0,0,@joewalshrocks Hello! No, alas! But an Admin can change the team icon, if that's the icon you mean: https://t.co/AVAi3UnNT9
Slack,1,0,@Brammm You can't, but it's an interesting idea — thanks! 🤔🙇‍♀️
Slack,0,0,@godling_zlm Not ideal, but you could temporarily zoom with Ctrl/Cmd = 🤔 (And you can return to default zoom with Ctrl/Cmd 0)
Slack,0,0,@Gyunlim Oh sorry — misunderstood! There isn't — sorry about that 🙌
Slack,0,0,@evilneuro That's so good to hear … on balance 😅🙌😱
Slack,0,0,@roccetry This isn't on our immediate roadmap, sorry — but we'll certainly note your feedback for the team 🙌
Slack,0,0,@Gyunlim Might just be a case of talking to a Team Owner or Admin to get this created, depending on team settings 👍
Slack,1,2,@vineetkaul Oh! On desktop, if you go to Preferences > Messages & Media > and untick the 'Convert Emoticons' option, does that help things?
Slack,2,0,@z_anderle Ah, so sorry, Žan. We're afraid that's the case for now. We know there's a lot to improve when it comes to managing many teams. 😔
Slack,0,0,@patleeman Thanks for the love! Is this the new input on mobile apps? We can't reveal too much, but we really appreciate the feedback!
Slack,0,0,@alpennec 💖
Slack,0,0,@I_am_Dan_Ellis So sorry, Dan. This is a known issue that we're hoping to fix as quickly as possible. Having to read it 10 times is no good.
Slack,1,0,@alpennec 👋 Mind asking this question through feedback@slack.com? We'll be able to explain better without the character limit!
Slack,0,0,@username081 We'd recommend speaking to your Team Owners or Admins, but we're always available at feedback@slack.com or /feedback.
Slack,0,0,@teppo You got it. Thanks for your patience! 🙇
Slack,1,1,@big_roof Any time! 🐻
Slack,0,0,@notthatnathan Ah, in Slack, click 'Slack' in the top toolbar, then 'About Slack'. Our latest v2.6.3 may fix this! https://t.co/RvUnYTicJJ
Slack,0,0,@Gyunlim Default channels for User Groups already exists! 🎉 More info on our Help Center: https://t.co/hcACFGYqyZ
Slack,1,0,@nickansel Gotcha! On desktop, does Preferences > Messages & Media > 'Show images and files...' > 'Even if they're larger than 2MB' help?
Slack,1,0,@JamesSLock Hmm, would you mind writing in so we can take a look? Sounds rather odd and we'd love to help! Here ➡️ https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,0,0,@beckerben Ah, fair point. We'll feedback this to the team. Thanks for letting us know and apologies for the oversight! 🙏
Slack,0,0,@liubinskas Ugh, sorry you had to go to those lengths. Glad to hear you're back up and running though.
Slack,0,0,@jimmyzelinskie Ah, yikes! So sorry. Turns out you've run into a known bug we're currently working to fix. Please hang tight! 🏄
Slack,0,0,@JamesSLock Oh no! 🙈 Sorry for the grossness. What version of the iOS app are you currently using?
Slack,0,0,@ChrisCharabaruk For now, it is available in the direct download version: https://t.co/Rvzftwbhdb
Slack,0,0,@ChrisCharabaruk It's not something we've gotten around to implementing in the Windows Store app just yet. 📝 We'll pass the request across.
Slack,0,0,@aimee_ebooks Hmm, are you up-to-date or is it that new unread messages are not loading? 🕵️
Slack,0,0,@nickansel Ahh, you'd like to see the size of the GIF before you post it? Was it from an integration, an uploaded image, or URL?
Slack,0,0,@chrislorensson Head to https://t.co/dgHMiuFSdY to pick up a pair and support a great cause. 👌✨
Slack,0,0,@celsodantas We're really sorry for the hassle. 😔 We'll keep working on it! If you have any further trouble, please let us know.
Slack,1,0,@alpennec Thanks, Axel!
Slack,1,0,@agisilaosts Ugh, we're so sorry. Is this on desktop or mobile? Mac, Windows, Linux? Android or iOS?
Slack,1,0,@dougblackio We can sure consider it, thanks for the feedback! 🙇
Slack,1,0,@DavidMuroII That's quite the interesting thought. 💡 We'll definitely take the suggestion on board, thanks for reaching out! 🙇
Slack,1,0,@alpennec Too easy! We'll keep you posted. 💌
Slack,0,0,@celsodantas Sorry, friend. Please try swiping right-to-left to open the menu, then Settings > Advanced > Reset Cache. Does that help? 🤞
Slack,1,0,@picsoung Nifty! 🤖🎈
Slack,0,0,@DaleskaPr We're so sorry! Can you please try refreshing with ctrl/cmd + R if you're still experiencing troubles?
Slack,0,0,@djshiow Oh, the horror! 😱 Maybe a custom emoji in your status will fill the gaping void. https://t.co/Tly0GdV0H8
Slack,0,0,@jake_quade Nice! ⬛️⚪️🍃
Slack,1,0,@jake_quade Oh you flatterer, you! Do you have a fantastic custom theme? Share with the class! 🎨💻
Slack,0,0,@alex112269 Oh brilliant, we hope it helps! If not, just give us another shout and we'll lend a hand. 🔊
Slack,1,0,@sujdark Ooooh, great suggestion. We'll make a note of this for future development! In writing, for now. 😅
Slack,0,0,@CocoKur Hmm, we’re not quite sure what you’re looking for, but if you drop a note to feedback@slack.com we can see what we can share! 🙏
Slack,1,0,@jake_quade 🐱💭🌃💙
We'll let the team know that this is something you'd like to see. Thanks, Jake!
Slack,0,0,@MykeBates We'll consider it! However, this is something that's not likely to change any time soon, unfortunately. Sorry about that, Myke.
Slack,1,0,@alpennec Want us to tweet you when we have a fix? 🙏
Slack,0,0,@alpennec We apologize for the troubles here! We're looking into fixing this so that it requires fewer taps to answer on iOS.
Slack,1,0,@eggsbuttersugar Great feedback! We see how this would be helpful, and we'll pass your tweet along to our Mac desktop folks. 😉
Slack,1,0,@SuperTonic64 Not at the moment, sorry! Suggested statuses can only be set at the team level. 💁🏼
Slack,3,1,@RuePee @KristyT Ah, we're afraid that we won't be streaming or recording this event, but we're hoping to write a blog post post-event. ☺️
Slack,1,0,@ryanvarick Or were you looking to set unique DM notification preferences on a one-by-one basis, like you can do for channels?
Slack,0,0,@ryanvarick Hmm! You can set your notifications for DMs and keywords only. Does that work? It's under Preferences > Notifications.
Slack,1,0,@bobschwenkler @joy014 Pssst. We made this happen for you. Refresh your app with Cmd/Ctrl + R to play m4a files in Slack now. 😉
Slack,1,0,@iamtherealcmk Thanks for the suggestion! We see how one unified account would be supremely handy for you.
Slack,0,0,@teppo It's a bug! And it affects all audio files on iOS, not just WAV files. Sorry, we'll fix this – want us to tweet you when it's done?
Slack,0,0,@alex112269 Oh no, we're so sorry! Are you still having troubles? If so, which version of the app are you seeing this on? 🙏
Slack,0,0,@bobschwenkler @joy014 Ah, no, .m4a files aren't supported yet! Sorry, Bob. We'd like to offer this ability for .m4a files in the future.
Slack,0,0,@6byNine Ah, we see what you mean! Sorry for any confusion - we've passed this along to our team for a closer look! 👀
Slack,0,0,@MykeBates Not at the moment, we're afraid. We've only allowed certain widely-adopted services to display inline HTML and play media. 🙁
Slack,0,0,@mtjmelody Ack, are you referring to the "Find my Team" email? 😞
Slack,1,0,@NicholasNConrad Thanks for the suggestion! We see what you mean and we'll give it more thought. 🙇🏻
Slack,0,0,@f1xedgear Sorry about that! There's no way to turn it off, as Slackbot is designed to be a helper bot who responds to your messages. 😣
Slack,0,0,@BlnaryMlke That's fair. We'll keep noodling on how we can keep folks from different teams connected while preserving the team structure.
Slack,0,0,@kpfefferle We're afraid that's a desktop-only preference for now. Sorry about that, Kevin. Perhaps in the future. 😓
Slack,0,0,@sarbbottam You can check your team's Admins and Owners from https://t.co/Pixhy359hq > click on "view admins".
Slack,0,0,@sarbbottam For now, could you perhaps invite a team Admin (not necessarily an Owner) into the channel so they can archive it?
Slack,0,0,@sarbbottam Oof. We agree, that's bad. We're planning on fixing this.
Slack,0,0,@nileshtrivedi Oh! A team Admin or Owner will need to get in touch with us at feedback@slack.com to request a shared invite link first. 😉
Slack,0,0,@daphne_mir Oh, y'know. Mostly because of reasons. And stuff. 😇
Slack,1,0,@EM_marketing Could you kindly drop us a note at feedback@slack.com? Our Specialists would like to take a closer look at this! 💫🚀
Slack,0,0,@jugrand Time for a midnight snack! 🍧
Slack,0,0,@NotZombies 😕 Would you mind writing in to feedback@slack.com? We'd like to investigate this.
Slack,0,0,@lwaldal We see why it could be handy to automatically adjust this. Thanks for sharing this suggestion! 👍
Slack,0,0,@lwaldal The app should adjust the timing of your messages but adjusting your profile timezone is a manual step. 🙁
Slack,0,0,@terceravencida ¡Lo sentimos! ☹️ Mira al FAQ de PlusPlus: https://t.co/pGJvx2KB1D o los puedes contactar a ellos a support@plusplus.chat.
Slack,1,0,@alyssamazzina ...been no activity for the last week. We hope this helps! 🎀 2/2
Slack,1,0,@alyssamazzina Aha! A DM will be removed from your sidebar if there's no unread messages, it hasn't been opened lately, and there's... 1/2
Slack,1,0,@jayman Yuck. 🚫⚪️ Would you mind dropping us a message at feedback@slack.com so we can take a look under the hood?
Slack,0,0,@jshiplett We don’t have that data available, but we do listen to all user feedback. We’ll be happy to share your thoughts with the team. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@itsQuietEarp Sorry for the hassle! Check out this article from our Help Center for step-by-step instructions: https://t.co/FqmSyx2g39
Slack,2,0,@riklomas Ah, we see what you mean. We'll pass this onto the team for a look! 🔍👀
Slack,0,0,@aSloppyJo3 Jeepers, that sounds buggy. We'd like to investigate this – could you kindly drop us a line at feedback@slack.com? 💌🐛
Slack,0,0,@vasantkumar Noted! No plans to share at the moment, but we'll pass your thoughts to the team. Thanks for sending your feedback our way! 📚
Slack,0,0,@ParkerNielsen Oh, that would be wonderful! No plans to share at the moment but we'll let the team know you'd like to see this happen. 📸
Slack,0,0,@domurtag Sorry about that! If you head into your System Prefs > General and toggle your default browser, does that fix the issue?
Slack,0,0,@TheJoWo So if you have more than 10 active DMs going, Slack should keep them all open. Is that not happening for you?
Slack,0,0,@TheJoWo Looks like we had it wrong. Slack will display all recent active conversations and close DMs with no activity over time.
Slack,0,0,@daveixd @TrueHarlequin @DesignerHangout Turning that feature off is a team setting! Talk to an owner or admin: https://t.co/L15Q1EAh7K
Slack,0,0,@iservin 👍
Slack,0,0,@matthaggerty Oh dear! Could you please try resetting your cache, or dropping us a line? feedback@slack.com
Slack,0,0,@outlandishjosh  😱 Yikes! Are you able to connect to Slack via a browser?
Slack,0,0,@BlnaryMlke We're listening! While Slack is intended for closed work groups, we'll be happy to pass your feedback on.
Slack,0,0,@6byNine Each grey line under the date indicates a separate incident. Is that what you're referring to?
Slack,0,0,@sarbbottam Good grief, sorry for the frustration. Your Team Owner can change that setting at https://t.co/zFsyMlLi7M. 🌸
Slack,1,0,@ThatHarmanSingh Oh, that really would be easier to view for a long list of keywords. We'll pass that feedback along. Sorry! 🙏
Slack,0,0,@notthatnathan Yikes, sorry for the trouble! What version of the app are you running?
Slack,0,0,@KWarren Rats. Would you mind dropping us a note at feedback@slack.com some more investigation? 🤔📬
Slack,0,0,@ChrisCharabaruk Unfortunately this is not possible right now – but we hear you! That would be handy.
Slack,6,0,@LauraHayesDC :blush: We'll pass that along to her manager. 

(Or rather, to use first person for once, I'll pass t… https://t.co/1Np1eUeWNR
Slack,0,0,@openjck We definitely hear you. It's something we've discussed and certainly would make life easier if you're on multiple teams.
Slack,1,0,@LessIsMoi If you go into that channel and type `/remind list`, you'll see the channel-specific reminders listed along with delete links.
Slack,1,0,@fahrenq Yikes, sorry for the frustration – but thank you for sending this our way! Feedback noted. 📝🙇
Slack,0,0,@jimmyzelinskie 😬 Really sorry. Is this on mobile? If so, which device?
Slack,0,0,@alyssamazzina DMs stay open even if the other side closes them. Do you have the setting on to only view channels/DMs with unread messages?
Slack,0,0,@iservin Definitely not fun. 😞 To help troubleshoot, can you log into Slack through Chrome and see if the same thing happens there?
Slack,0,0,@domurtag Huh. And links from Slack are opening in a brand new window instead of just a new tab of an existing window?
Slack,0,0,@CocoKur A survey conducted within Slack? You might want to look through the App Directory. For example: https://t.co/zSOpHt4AtP
Slack,0,0,@jasonmulligan Mmm, copy/pasta sounds delicious! 🍝 😋 Are snippets a possibility for you here? https://t.co/BvrXwLu2JR
Slack,0,0,@nerdgirl We designed it to match All Unreads, though it can be a bit confusing since it is different than all channels. 😬 Sorry! 🙏
Slack,0,0,@jayman 🤔 Try pressing `Shift + Esc` in that team to mark everything as read. If that doesn't work, clear the cache: `Help > Clear Cache`
Slack,1,0,@jordan_ryan Ah we see. We're making incremental changes to memory use as often as we can. Thanks for your patience!
Slack,0,0,@emad_younis 👋 Muting and blocking of individual Slack team members is not something we have plans for. We'll note the request though!
Slack,1,0,@JSn1nj4 It's something the team is considering carefully!
Slack,1,0,@venatiodecorus We appreciate the feedback and we'll pass it on!
Slack,5,1,@LauraHayesDC This is a good public service you are performing. But that ain't no robot. Just someone here at Slack.
Slack,0,0,@EM_marketing You can choose your account on setup. However, you can only have one Asana account associated with Slack at a time.
Slack,0,0,@jordan_ryan Ah, have you tried "snoozing" them? https://t.co/ELuFDoqR2q
Slack,0,0,@nerdgirl Ah, that's because threads always open at the top. This is an interesting point, though: we'll pass it along to the team here! 📝
Slack,1,0,@HoldenthePage Thanks for flagging this. Our security team is aware and working on the issue.
Slack,0,0,@higgis Hrmm, that's no good. To clarify, is this happening in one of our desktop apps, in a browser, or on your mobile device? 🤔
Slack,1,0,@sonyybalonyy 👍
Slack,0,0,@lwaldal Oh, no! Have you even gone into your profile and adjusted your time zone there? 😞
Slack,0,0,@steve_lacy Thanks for letting us know! If it happens again please check what version you are running and update if possible. 🙌
Slack,0,0,@nate23 So sorry about this! Could you please write in so we can get some information? feedback@slack.com 🙌
Slack,0,0,@gonedark Restarting the app should cut that DM list down to 10 names + Slackbot, and hopefully you can trim things down from there! ✂️
Slack,1,0,@risiofficial Oh we are. We like everyone! 🌼
Slack,0,0,@TheArchivum Oh, you can't make a private channel public, alas. You'd have to spin up a whole new channel in that case!
Slack,0,0,@TheJoWo ...around! ⭐️ 2/2
Slack,0,0,@TheJoWo You'll always get reset back to 10 after restarting, sadly. You can star the important DMs, though, so
 they always stick... 1/2
Slack,0,0,@garethkbc Absolutely! If it doesn't fit in140 characters, drop us a note at feedback@slack.com? 💖
Slack,1,0,@RyanGWilson Ah, yes, unfortunately. This bug is on our radar, though, and we're hoping to get it all fixed up very soon! 📂😓
Slack,0,0,@sgulbetekin Oh, no! We were having some trouble with this earlier, but everything should be A-OK now. Are you still running into this? 😞
Slack,0,0,@DanielGonzo2016 You could use User Groups for this! For more info on those… https://t.co/ZKQJK378Fr
Slack,1,0,@xtinaashbaugh Oh! That's a lot of pressure. We're just glad to be helping! 😅
Slack,1,0,@jphenow Oh, yikes! Looks like the app is suddenly missing its style data. Is that persisting after refreshing or clearing out its cache? 😬
Slack,0,0,@kpeckett Thanks for letting us know! Things should indeed be working normally again now. 🙌
Slack,0,0,@kpeckett Yikes, sorry for the trouble! Could you please try to reload by hitting Ctrl+R?
Slack,0,0,@jasonmulligan Uh-oh 🙈 that certainly should stop the search! Sorry for the troubles. We'll happily pass this onto the team 🗒
