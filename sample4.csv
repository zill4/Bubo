Slack,0,0,@Sandrick13 😭  So sorry! For now, the app is only available in English.
Slack,1,0,@altcoinio @naval If you drop us a line at that email address, we'll be able to connect you with the right folks. Thanks!

Slack,0,0,@altcoinio Oh hi! You can definitely pop us a message here, or drop us a line at feedback@slack.com and we'll be happy to hear from you!
Slack,1,0,@timoreimann  As for emoji, this is a known bug. So sorry for the trouble. We'll try to fix this quickly! 🐛
Slack,0,0,@timoreimann Thanks for sharing these ideas! 💡 We don't have plans to change the design, but we are considering adding shortcuts!
Slack,1,0,@mhausenblas We don't support consolidated logins across teams for security & administrative reasons. 👍 We're sorry for the frustration.
Slack,9,0,@pinquitte Ah, thanks for this feedback! We'll share this with the team to take a look at. 🎉
Slack,1,0,@CheshireSwift Yes! We're definitely looking at how we can best improve in this regard. Sorry for the long wait on this. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@holaMau Who, us? 😉
Slack,1,0,@tomsebesta We just wanted to spruce things up a bit! 🎀
Slack,0,0,@ejp_13 There isn't a way to do so at the moment, but interesting idea! We'll think about that. Thanks! 💡
Slack,0,0,@wolframkriesing Hmm, we'd love to hear more about what you'd like to see change with threads, if you have something in mind? 🙇
Slack,0,0,@debianguy It's definitely something we're looking into— we hear you! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@electricarchaeo Woops, we meant worth a peek.
Slack,2,0,@electricarchaeo We're wondering if you've heard about our Slack for Education plan? It might be work a peek! https://t.co/xI4p8fBovY
Slack,0,0,@electricarchaeo Ahh we see what you mean. We don't have a way to turn off the limit message at this time, our apologies.
Slack,0,0,@ThomasDuerlund We are indeed! Sorry for the confusion 🙇
Slack,1,0,@jeffm8_bs Oh, we see what you did there. 🔥
Slack,0,0,@ehrlicp We're glad you're liking them! ⭐❤️
Slack,0,0,@TimHaines Hmm, we'd love to take a closer look, could you drop us a line here: https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X Thanks! 🙏
Slack,1,0,@ThomasDuerlund 2.6.3 won't be in the Mac App Store. It is a direct download version only.
Slack,0,0,@natetharp In that case please write to feedback@slack.com with the team details and we'll take a look.
Slack,0,0,@electricarchaeo When did you delete the messages? The team statistics update once a day.
Slack,0,0,@natetharp Hmm, are you a single-channel or multi-channel guest?
Slack,0,0,@janephilipps Oh that certainly doesn't look right. Thanks for letting us know. We're looking into it now.
Slack,0,0,@Hinchable By shortcuts do you mean text substitutions? Or something else?
Slack,0,0,@garrettmurray We're working to improve performance every day!
Slack,0,0,@RyanWoodDFW Not files that were shared in Private Channels or Direct Messages that you’re not part of. 2/2
Slack,0,0,@RyanWoodDFW Unfortunately not, as you will only be able to view files that your User Account already has access to – ie, Public Files 1/2
Slack,73,15,And congrats to the 7 new Slack Fund companies! Meet the new kids on the block. https://t.co/x2k5guuXJ7
Slack,0,0,@RyanWoodDFW We put those there so that they're easier to find, but they still don't count against the storage limit.
Slack,0,0,@misanthrobey We'll let the team know that's something you'd like to see!
Slack,0,0,@TwistedEdge That update will be rolling out to all users over the next day or so.
Slack,0,0,@irace Would you please write to feedback@slack.com with the team details? We'll look into it.
Slack,1,0,@cmgurley Ah, sorry for the troubles. That sounds like a bug we're investigating. 🔍👀
Slack,0,0,@RyanWoodDFW No, those don't count in terms of storage space.
Slack,0,0,@tlg5208 We're working on it, but no ETA to share at the moment. In the meantime, links unfurl, so pasting an image URL will work for now. ✌
Slack,0,0,@ndrewmcknight We don't currently have a Search filter to exclude–if, but we'll let the team know you'd be a fan of such a feature.
Slack,0,0,@RyanWoodDFW Any file your team uploads to Slack counts.

Slack,1,0,@ElijahLynn We hear you – it's something the team is working to improve. Please stay tuned. 📻
Slack,0,0,@ndrewmcknight Not sure if that would work for you and your team in the meantime, but it's something to consider. 😊 2/2
Slack,1,0,@ndrewmcknight We hear you. We have a system in place where we add a designated "this is off topic" :raccoon: emoji to our own messages 1/2
Slack,0,0,@rothgar We support several ways of installing apps on a team — is there something specific you’re looking for?
Slack,0,0,@punkeel Sorry about that. It's a known bug that our team is working to fix.
Slack,87,28,Over 1,000 Slack Apps in the App Directory and 155,000 active developers. Thank you! More good stuff in this update. https://t.co/GI8hBxsJa8
Slack,0,0,@NeshasAgenda Thanks – the team will get back to you asap. 😊
Slack,1,0,@YesThatMGibson We use "🍅, 🍅" instead.
Slack,1,1,@agarciatv You'll find all our current openings at https://t.co/UzXwhFXn7i – if you see one that you like, please do apply! 🎈
Slack,0,0,@mackaaij Right now the decision to share a Thread back to channel is given to the Thread-er, but we'll share your feedback with the team!
Slack,0,0,@beekay__ Ah, no unfortunately. When we retired the message archives, it removed the old bulk delete message options too.
Slack,0,0,@MadeByEW Thank you kindly!
Slack,0,0,@GenuineJack The LOG (Lack of GIF) Blues are real, and are best combatted by at least three cute animal gifs. Emoji help, too. 🐶🐱🐭🐼🐨🐣
Slack,1,0,@M_J_Robbins It's something the team is considering, but we have no ETA to share on when that might become available. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@chasityscooper Is it the same problem? We'd love to see the results of https://t.co/82x87HcmUR; they'll help us identify the issue.
Slack,0,0,@NeshasAgenda Okie dokie. We're sorry to ask, but do you mind running the test at https://t.co/82x87HcmUR and clicking "Tell us about it"?
Slack,1,0,@Nomaanism ...secret corner! We know you want access to your important messages, but we can't override your company's compliance. (3/3)
Slack,0,0,@Nomaanism ...certain channels or files aren't subject to retention. If you ask an Admin to explain the policy, you may find a... (2/3)
Slack,0,0,@Nomaanism Again, that depends on your company's retention settings. Some companies choose to retain DMs but not channels, or... (1/3)
Slack,0,0,@NeshasAgenda We're so sorry. 😔 Is this in an app or in a browser? If it's a browser: does it work in a different one, out of curiosity?
Slack,0,0,@ndrewmcknight Interesting! Not something we've thought of, but we'll pass this along to the team. 🤓
Slack,0,0,@Nomaanism That depends on your company's compliance rules and specific retention policies— we recommend asking a team Admin about this. 🙊
Slack,0,0,@beekay__ All of our archives are now accessible in the app. 🙃
Slack,1,0,@bulgarianjer Our twitter integration (https://t.co/SSDRKrdb9a) will only auto-post public tweets right now. 🙊
Slack,0,0,@x_ColdPizza_x Yikes, it shouldn't be crashing. Could you hit Help > Show Logs in Explorer > send the .zip file to feedback@slack.com?
Slack,0,0,@JmmyBrdn No issues that we know of! Does a cache reset help? Swipe left > Advanced > Reset Cache. 🙌
Slack,0,0,@jhoskins Here's more about it: https://t.co/07Z0MUcecs
Slack,1,0,@jhoskins The Quick Switcher is Cmd+K, or find it at the bottom of the channel list. The desktop app also will list all your teams! 💖
Slack,0,0,@Nomaanism All messages, including those that have been starred/pinned, are affected by message retention policies. 😶
Slack,0,0,@MadeByEW It did! We like to spruce things up from time to time. 🌻
Slack,0,0,@joovlaki ...key bindings issue is new. We'd love to take a closer look. Do you mind writing in to feedback@slack.com? 🙏 (2/2)
Slack,0,0,@joovlaki That's no good! 😞 You're running into a bug with our app in Kubuntu where we don't mark messages as read, but the... (1/2)
Slack,0,0,@ehrlicp Nice idea! We'll pass it along. ⭐️ For now, do regular stars, "mark as unread", and reminders help?
Slack,1,0,@EricSan No way to merge channels right now, but you can use export/import to merge teams: https://t.co/mo1B01kEpd.
Slack,0,0,@amjadali_01 No plans to bring it back right now, but thanks for the feedback!
Slack,0,0,@rpcutts No option right now, but that's a good idea! 💡For now, team Owners can limit who can post in general to help keep it clean.
Slack,0,0,@KBIA_engineer No plans right now, but we'll let the team know that this is something you'd like to see!
Slack,0,0,@mackaaij ... thread members. Assume that threads you don't see are side-conversations that you don't need to see. 🙃 (2/2)
Slack,0,0,@mackaaij You'll be notified about the thread if someone mentions you, and relevant info should be shared back to the channel by... (1/2)
Slack,0,0,@joovlaki Sorry about this! Do your key bindings ever work in the Slack app on Kubuntu, or not at all? 🤔
Slack,1,0,@davidcarlton Us too! We're exploring the best way to implement this, so please stay tuned!
Slack,0,0,@natearcher Posts in restricted channels can have emoji reactions. If you want to reply, then sharing to another channel is a good plan. 👌
Slack,0,0,@cybroxde Oh no, so sorry! Can you drop a note to feedback@slack.com so we can take a closer look? 👀
Slack,1,0,@TheoBlochet We don't yet but we'll add it to our emoji set in the future!
Slack,0,0,@allanrosenow 😉
Slack,1,0,@robcas65 Corgis are the best! 😍
Slack,0,0,@TimvdLippe Sorry to hear that, we'll keep an eye out for your message. 👍
Slack,2,0,@SamBakesSalmon @enjoyLaCroix As long as it's not the coconut one. 😉
Slack,0,0,@DZittersteyn Files would be nice to have included in that, we agree! No set plans right now, but we'll pass along your feedback. 🙌
Slack,0,0,@natearcher They can't, but that's a good idea! Will pass it along as a feature request.
Slack,2,0,@chrisloftus It's a team effort! 😊
Slack,0,0,@EddieHinkle You're not insane, it's all new! ;)
Slack,1,0,@crystalenka No problem, and thanks for letting us know. We will keep our eyes peeled for this!
Slack,0,0,@crystalenka Can you please confirm what device you're both accessing with and how often this happens?
Slack,0,0,@drmmr763 Thanks for letting us know. We were just about to let you know that that option is still available! :)
Slack,1,0,@VictorZamanian There's no way to do that at this time unfortunately, but we can let the team know that you'd like to see this!
Slack,0,0,@jeffeisley Sorry that you don't like it! It's a big change for sure. Will be sure to pass this feedback along for you Jeff!
Slack,1,0,@interTed It looks like he's very deep in thought. 😂 💖

Slack,0,0,@SIGKILL If you write into feedback@slack.com, we'll be able to clear this up for you 🙏
Slack,0,0,@notthatnathan Gah! Looks as though you're running into a bug 🐛 We're working on it — stay tuned 📻
Slack,0,0,@notthatnathan Hmm. Are you running the latest version of our app? Also, does a refresh help?
Slack,0,0,@HarryBones Phew 😅 If this happens again (fingers crossed it won't), please do let us know!
Slack,0,0,@jamesckemp Hmm. Not that we're aware of 🤔 would you mind writing in so we can get some more information? 🙏 https://t.co/a3LfcTHHMr
Slack,1,0,@giblet22 Cool idea, Matthew. We'll happily pass it on 💡🚀
Slack,0,0,@HarryBones Nope, not that we're aware of at least 🤔 are you having having issues on the desktop app, mobile app or browser?
Slack,1,0,@russell So sorry for the troubles here. It's still early days for Threads — we're working on it 🛠
Slack,1,0,@elmapache We're so glad to hear it! Thank you 🙇
Slack,0,0,@altcoinio 👍
Slack,1,0,@paulwrblanchard We're on it — we'll have a fix in place as soon as we can. Sorry about that!
Slack,1,0,@davkals We appreciate the thoughtful feedback. We're sorry to hear this isn't working so well for your team. We take this onboard 🙌
Slack,1,0,@andilanuza Good eyes! 🕵️‍♀️
Slack,2,0,@HispaBTC If you haven't, feel free to write in if there's anything you'd like to put on our radar: https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,1,0,@altcoinio If it helps, you can use "my" instead of "<teamName>" to share links — it'll redirect to a user's own team if they're signed in.
Slack,1,0,@mattbrailsford Ace, thanks. Obviously if it keeps recurring, do let us know. We don't want you to have to keep clearing your cache 😅
Slack,0,0,@nicosaueressig Yes! https://t.co/xT3t3ZSlvg
Slack,1,0,@RobertGray We're so glad to hear it! Just make loud noises if we can help with anything 🗣📢📯🙀

Slack,0,0,@aexmo Sorry about that! in the app, could you try Settings > Advanced > Reset Cache?
Slack,0,0,@mattbrailsford If not, please do drop us a line: https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,0,0,@mattbrailsford Ah! In the app, could you try Settings > Advanced > Reset local storage — does that help?
Slack,0,0,@SilverPrince98 Do you mind writing to us with some more details? https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,0,0,@dbrckmn Thanks for the feedback — we're sorry for the annoyance. We'll take this on board.

Slack,0,0,@LewisTheobald Understood — thanks for writing in. We're really sorry for the slowness. Please bear with us — we'll get back to you soon.
Slack,1,0,@mikaoioi A dark theme is something we're exploring as we speak… 🌛🕶
Slack,0,0,@mattbrailsford Sorry about that. Desktop? If you catch up on your reading, does pressing Shift Escape to mark the team as read solve this?
Slack,0,0,@aexmo Sorry about that! Is this in any particular app?
Slack,0,0,@kevinresol Understood — thanks ever so much for the feedback 🙇🔘🔨
Slack,0,0,@aeris_mel There's no published list or anything like that, sorry 🙌
Slack,0,0,@quintinwillison We appreciate the feedback — sorry for the frustration here. Is there a particular problem or use-case with minimum width?
Slack,1,0,@kurtybot Sorry for the frustration! We'll take that feedback on board.
Slack,0,0,@SilverPrince98 Sorry for the trouble! Is this in any particular app?
Slack,0,0,@ElBlivion Sorry about that! For now, disabling the All Unreads view is the only way to do this. We take the feedback onboard, though 🚢🚛
Slack,1,0,@alehandrof We're a bit behind, sorry! In the meantime, um… :flag-fr: :bread: ? 😬
Slack,1,0,@TheDannix It is — we're so sorry for the trouble. We're looking into it 🔎🛃
Slack,1,0,@MattSmith_PL "Reward" is a strong word… 😉
Slack,0,0,@TimvdLippe Please drop us a line if that doesn't help: https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,0,0,@TimvdLippe Sorry about that! In the app, could you try Settings, Advanced, Reset local storage?
Slack,0,0,@mathieulegrand We're really sorry about this. We're looking into it 🕵️‍♀️🚀
Slack,0,0,@EWDurbin Sorry about that! We're looking into this. Please bear with us.
Slack,0,0,@AndraZaharia Sorry about that! This sounds like one to write in about, if that's okay: https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,0,0,@mHiSaN Sorry for the annoyance! This is on our radar — please bear with us.
Slack,2,0,@Renee_Gardner_ You can grab some over at https://t.co/qpyV08GSGc 🎉🎉🎉

Slack,0,0,@BenDTU No concrete plans as yet. 😬 For now, you can set up one as a custom emoji if you'd like! ✨  https://t.co/Tly0GdV0H8 🏂
Slack,1,0,@coderlily We can sure consider it! It'd be a nice option to have, particularly in busier channels. Thanks for the feedback! 📝
Slack,1,0,@swyx Ugh, 😔 sorry for the troubles. The team is working on this as we speak. Hold tight! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@craigkeller Thanks friend! We'll get to it ASAP. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@TheN0ric Thanks for the feedback on this! Just to make sure we're looking at the same thing — are you referring to the vertical one?  🤔
Slack,0,0,@infojunke Yikes! No issues we're aware of, does a refresh with cmd/ctrl + R fix it? If not, please write us via feedback@slack.com. 🙇
Slack,1,0,@mtschammer We might be able to help you out! Can you please drop us a line at feedback@slack.com so we can lend a hand? 🙏
Slack,0,0,@craigkeller (2/2) ...do you mind dropping some details (teams, screenshots, device etc.) to https://t.co/WeWXcwsZIU? 🙏
Slack,0,0,@craigkeller Very odd! We'd recommend a reinstall but would also love to investigate if you have the time...  (1/2)
Slack,0,0,@kylemalinda We'll pass your kind words along. Thank you, Kyle! 🌻
Slack,1,0,@_lenovouser Oh no! Sorry, Silas. Please send us a note: https://t.co/WeWXcwsZIU 🔎✉️ We'll look into it.
Slack,0,0,@craigkeller Oh boy! 😿 Sorry, Craig. Swipe right-to-left to open the menu, then tap Settings > Advanced > Reset Cache. Does that help?
Slack,0,0,@niallsmart Hmm, after a polite conversation with your team? 🙊😹💝
Slack,0,0,@bdarfler Ah, so sorry, Ben — this sounds like one of our known issues. Does clearing all unreads on desktop with Shift+Esc help at all?
Slack,0,0,@joeflateau 🤛🏼
Slack,0,0,@joeflateau Thanks for understanding! ✨
Slack,0,0,@joeflateau 'Background activity' means that Slack updates channels, checks for notifications, etc. for a short time after exiting the app.
Slack,0,0,@joeflateau 👋 Apologies for any confusion! We don't need your location.
Slack,1,0,@jeriahlau Thanks! 🏆😘
Slack,0,0,@ZeroDistraction Phew, we're glad to hear it! 😅 If you have any further hassles, please drop us a note: feedback@slack.com 💌
Slack,0,0,@XpriNS No worries at all! Either way, it's a great idea to have a similar indicator when the thread is open on the right side. 💡
Slack,2,0,@cherise_ch Hey Cherise! Sorry about this — if it's part of the new emoji set, we're still working on getting them on our desktop apps. 💔
Slack,0,0,@XpriNS Huh, that'd be neat! Similar to how new messages are highlighted in the 'All Threads' view?
Slack,1,0,@pnwthomas Got it! We can definitely see what you mean. We'll talk about it with the team some more. Thank you again! 💖
Slack,0,0,@XpriNS Ooh, that's an idea! Where in the channel would you suggest they go to be most effective for this? 🤔
Slack,0,0,@pnwthomas Is your team currently using DND to avoid pings in the late hours? We find that's a handy way to prevent those, too!
Slack,1,0,@KingsdsNetwork We've passed along your thank you to him! So happy to hear you're happy! 💞
Slack,0,0,@pnwthomas Interesting idea! Thanks for suggesting this. We'll give it some thought. Thanks ✨
Slack,0,0,@tomfenske Good eye! 😉
Slack,1,0,@ramblingjane Sorry about all this trouble! We're definitely treating this as a bug, and hoping to get it resolved quickly! 🙏
Slack,0,0,@deim0s13 Anytime, friend! 👋
Slack,1,0,@deim0s13 We do support Edge, as long as it's version 31 or newer. 👍
Slack,0,0,@LucavonDE We're sorry to hear you don't like the icon! There's no way to change it right now, but we'll share your feedback with the team.
Slack,1,0,@codetheory Ah! We're glad to hear it's sorted out for you! If more strangeness crops up, definitely let us know! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@codetheory Hmm, could the notification be for a message in a different team you're signed into on mobile?
Slack,7,0,@kentbrew But DAAAAD! (Sorry, we couldn't help it.)
Slack,1,0,@coryborg 🐔🦋🐖😍
Slack,1,0,@uNcleargamer @TaehyunLim Yes! With our latest release you can toggle off message previews in Notifications on iOS to keep those hidden. ✨
Slack,0,0,@ramblingjane Hmmm... 🤔 Can you please try the same scenario, but this time use Cmd+1 and let us know if that brings the app back?
Slack,1,0,@alpennec Good eye! We're working on getting those sorted out, thanks for bearing with us! ❤️

Slack,0,0,@jasonkarns ...feedback@slack.com 2/2
Slack,0,0,@jasonkarns Ah, we see. SSO should work straight from the app. If you are having trouble with LastPass/SSO, could you drop us a line?... 1/2
Slack,0,0,@MissBriSparkles Got it. We're taking a look now— should be back in touch with you very soon. Thanks for your patience! 🙌
Slack,0,0,@ashrafrahal Oh, no! 😰 What seems to be the problem?
Slack,0,0,@iMartyn Sorry about this! You found the workaround for the bug in this scenario. We're working on a fix, and appreciate your patience!
Slack,0,0,@jasonkarns Sorry, perhaps we've misunderstood. Are you unable to sign into the app at all? We suggested that flow for LastPass access.
Slack,0,0,@realbenfeldman Oh that doesn't sound good. Would you please write to feedback@slack.com so our iOS team can take a look?
Slack,0,0,@jasonkarns That will launch the app and sign you in there automatically. 2/2
Slack,0,0,@jasonkarns If you'd like, you can sign in with a browser and then choose "Open the Slack app" from the team menu. 1/2
Slack,0,0,@MiaAlanisPR We aren't seeing any issues with Posts. Could you please write to feedback@slack.com so we can take a closer look?
Slack,2,0,@mor10 Sorry! That definitely would make threads better. It's something we're exploring, so keep an eye out in the updates! 🙇 🙌
Slack,0,0,@moday77 There's no built in way at the moment, but you might have luck searching in the App Directory (https://t.co/nKkSzXWiV3) or Zapier!
Slack,0,0,@ramblingjane Oh no! Is it that you closed the app to the dock and you're looking for a shortcut to bring it back up into focus?
Slack,0,0,@gschueler You mean something different than the current process for uploading images? 🤔
Slack,0,0,@Iron_Sean That does sound weird! Please get in touch at feedback@slack.com and our Windows team will take a look.
Slack,1,0,@_minikori Thank you! We'll let the iOS team know about this.
Slack,0,0,@Tavarin That's no good. Would you please write to feedback@slack.com so our Android team can look into it?
Slack,0,0,@_minikori By, um, poop do you mean the app crashed? Or something else happened?
Slack,0,0,@__korpikopan__ We hear you. We're trying to make it better all the time.
Slack,0,0,@jesutherl Sorry about that. Please go into the main app menu and choose Help >  Clear Cache and Restart. Are things better after that?
Slack,1,0,@EssentiallyEric Hey there! It's something we're exploring though there's no way to enable that just yet. We'll pass the request along! 👨‍💻🍎
Slack,0,0,@maslowbeer That is unexpected. Could you please write to feedback@slack.com so we can get more details and investigate?
Slack,0,0,@PRKSpeaks That definitely could be handy! We'll pass the idea along. 🙌
Slack,0,0,@ShawnChittle Very odd! Would you mind writing in to feedback@slack.com for more detailed troubleshooting to figure out what's going wrong?
Slack,0,0,@ADAMATOMIC If you send a message in those channels does the badge go away?
Slack,0,0,@zachychan6 @willyhakim Right back at ya! 💘
Slack,0,0,@Iron_Sean Yes! In our desktop apps you’ll appear active when Slack's open and you're interacting with the computer. https://t.co/VjbuxOyvee
Slack,0,0,@jamesleebennett You could see if there's an app for that already: https://t.co/de6aPqPzkH 🎶  "Currently listening to: Rick Astley" 🎶
Slack,0,0,@jereswinnen In that case please write to feedback@slack.com. Our iOS team will look into this.
Slack,0,0,@KBIA_engineer The files page (https://t.co/w8ppVX9EC2) is one at a time, but you could try our API (https://t.co/0qoO35JOJ2) to go faster.
Slack,0,0,@AndraZaharia Oh no! Are these Slack desktop notifications for new messages in the app, or something else?
Slack,0,0,@MissBriSparkles Oh no. We're happy to check for you. 👀 Would you mind letting us know the name it came in under so we can search?
Slack,0,0,@willyhakim @zachychan6 If neither of those work, please write in to feedback@slack.com to investigate deeper because this is perplexing! 🤔
Slack,0,0,@zachychan6 @willyhakim Try clearing your app's local storage (Settings > Advanced > Reset local storage), or logging out of that team.
Slack,0,0,@cra We'd love to know more about what's wrong with it, so we can see about making improvements. 🙏
Slack,1,0,@brooksied Interesting! We'll think about it. Meantime, our Do Not Disturb feature should help (they'll see the message when they sign in).
Slack,0,0,@oliverfoggin We're terribly sorry. Are you signed into more than one team? If there's any you can afford to sign out of, we'd suggest that.
Slack,1,0,@UXfinley We're so glad to hear that! 😊
Slack,1,0,@hersh_amin If you're the primary owner, you can do so at https://t.co/hWVpGv5soL. 🔃
Slack,0,0,@jonnyzzz Oh no! So sorry. Were these regular messages or file uploads? When 4G returned, the message was still there but wouldn't send?
Slack,1,0,@HarrisonWeber We're sorry to say you can't. 😓
Slack,0,0,@iMartyn Hmm. If you read your most important messages, then hit shift-esc, does that help? (It should mark everything as read)
Slack,0,0,@briandsaunders @AmeliaEasten 🙃 😩 So sorry, and thanks for following up. Are images being uploaded through mobile, desktop app or browser?
Slack,0,0,@ArthurMingard Yay! We'll pass your idea along! 💡 Best way to catch up on mentions now is the Activity feed. (clicking `@` in the top right)
Slack,1,0,@rsiegel Aha, understood. We'll see what we can think up over here. 💭
Slack,1,0,@alpennec You make a good point; we'll share that with the Calls team. Thank you. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@_Woodgie You can always pick up a pair at https://t.co/qpyV08GSGc. And profits go to charity! 😅
Slack,0,0,@rsiegel You can share a message to a different channel and direct folks to continue the conversation there. Would that help?
Slack,0,0,@jereswinnen Hm. Are you by any chance active on the desktop app at the same time? Because we won't ping your phone if so. 📢
Slack,1,0,@oi_andrew Yep. You can allow signups from specific email domains at https://t.co/YPuK7R34ca, then they sign up at [team].slack.com/signup.
Slack,0,0,@eoghancunneen That's a very nifty idea — thank you! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@hjbme Ah yes, so sorry!
Slack,0,0,@jordbrauer We're gathering feedback on this, no set plans right now!
Slack,1,0,@AkiiZedd Happy to hear you got sorted in the end!
Slack,1,0,@ChrisChinch drop an email into pr@slack.com please! 🙌
Slack,0,0,@JofArnold 🦋🙏😊
Slack,1,1,@JofArnold Oh, well, there are block quotes for larger chunks of text using >>> at the start!
Slack,1,0,@jmwagner 🙌💖✨
Slack,3,0,@jmwagner Oof, that's annoying, sorry! If you swipe right to left, and select Settings > Advanced > Reset Cache this should clear the file.
Slack,0,0,@LewisTheobald Oh no, is this happening for your whole team? If you write in to feedback@slack.com we'll investigate! 🔎
Slack,0,0,@DionSegijn Hmm. 🤔 If you don't mind dropping us a line to feedback@slack.com we'll happily take a closer look!
Slack,0,0,@pennymerelle We beelieve in you. 🐝🙌💖
Slack,0,0,@BMatB 🤔 That's a strange one! Could you provide some details as to where you're seeing the emojis in emoji codes only?
Slack,0,0,@jmwagner Sorry–we meant have you tried to upload the picture from the mobile or desktop apps? Could you let us know which one?
Slack,0,0,@himayyay Thanks for the feedback! We're looking into making message formatting more straightforward for the future. 🙇
Slack,1,0,@jmwagner Sorry for the trouble! On which app did you try to upload the picture?
Slack,0,0,@sowasred2012 Sorry for the trouble! Our team will be able to help further at feedback@slack.com 🙏
Slack,0,0,@DionSegijn Sorry for the trouble! Are you trying to edit a message right after you sent it?
Slack,1,0,@efemoney_ Afraid not, sorry! But we'll share your feedback about the Compact theme to our product team. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@dteam69 Would you mind sending us a report at feedback@slack.com? Our team will take a closer look at why this is happening. 🙌
Slack,0,0,@alexhanschke Hope you had a good game! ⚽️🙌
Slack,0,0,@pmberry2007 Yes, that's true. 😞 Sorry for the hassle, Paul. Our team is aware and hopefully improvements should be made in the future. 🙌
Slack,0,0,@Gtdgeoff That's what we meant, sorry for the confusion! 🙏
Slack,0,0,@Gtdgeoff Sorry–we meant swipe from right to left, then scroll down to Settings and select the Sign out option.
Slack,0,0,@pmberry2007 We do! Your machine's language and keyboard settings will need to be set to English UK.
Slack,0,0,@dteam69 Is this happening on desktop or mobile?
Slack,0,0,@Gtdgeoff In a channel in that team, swipe left, then tap Settings, and scroll down for the Sign Out option 👍
Slack,0,0,@dteam69 Eep! What seems to be the trouble, sorry?
Slack,0,0,@ndrewbiddle 📝👍
Slack,0,0,@ndrewbiddle That's right — sorry about that. We'll note this as a feature request, though 🙌
Slack,1,0,@FahadKB Thank you for using Slack! We really appreciate it 💖
Slack,0,0,@joachim_d Thanks — we're so sorry for the hassle 🙌
Slack,0,0,@odtorson The Twitter app can also pull tweets from an account into a channel. We're following Twitter's TOS by asking for these permissions
Slack,0,0,@philandstuff Sorry for the frustration! We'll note for the team that this is something you'd like 🙇
Slack,0,0,@ndrewbiddle No OCR functionality, sorry, but Slack will index text-based PDFs 👍
Slack,0,0,@argen Please do let us know if not: https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,0,0,@argen Sorry about that! Does swiping left and tapping Settings > Advanced > Reset Cache help at all?
Slack,0,0,@joachim_d If that doesn't help, please drop us a line: https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,0,0,@joachim_d Oh no! Could you try swiping left from a channel and going to Settings > Advanced > Reset Cache 🙏
Slack,0,0,@femkesvs Thanks, friend! We'll get to it as soon as we can. 🏃
Slack,1,0,@_schristo Thanks for sharing! It could be a nice option for those who'd prefer to consume threads in-channel. We'll give it some thought! 🙌
Slack,0,0,@wcp285601662 This isn't something we can really give advice on. Our apologies! 🙇
Slack,1,0,@shakedog You can enable “approved apps”, and then restrict which apps can be installed. More info here: https://t.co/INbsOozeWu. 🙌
Slack,0,0,@Copons Well shucks! That's good to hear. 😊
Slack,0,0,@SeanLagged That's completely frustrating, sorry. 😔 It's something we want to support, and it's on our radar. Though no firm plans yet.
Slack,0,0,@ChiSenires Thanks for your kind words and your patience! 😊💖
Slack,0,0,@mikeknep Afraid so. 😔 You'll need to change the notification settings by clicking the gear cog icon in each group DM.
Slack,1,0,@pixelplotters Yep, gotcha! We'll make sure to pass this on to the team to consider further. Thanks for sharing. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@iAmirhasan Sorry for the hassle. 😔 Could you send us your logs from the Help menu under "Show Logs in Explorer" to feedback@slack.com? 🙇
Slack,1,0,@ChiSenires Argh, sorry for the hassle. 😔 It's definitely on our radar, and we'd love to support it. Though no concrete plans currently.
Slack,0,1,@hhariri Nothing to that extent. For more information: https://t.co/5UKOSFQe4l. We’re at feedback@slack.com if you have other questions!
Slack,1,0,@_ty13r There is no way to disable reminders from team members at the moment, but we'll share this feature request with the team.
Slack,0,0,@circulargenius You do you, Josh. 🤗 We're pleased to be of service!
Slack,0,0,@jonnyzzz We only push notifications after a period of inactivity on the desktop app. Would this explain why those two didn't come through?
Slack,0,0,@Copons We're sorry that it's not your cup of tea. Hopefully it will grow on you! 🌱🌿🌳
Slack,0,0,@saaiko 😘💅
Slack,0,0,@zachychan6 @willyhakim Good grief! Sorry, Zach. Does refreshing with Cmd/Ctrl + R stop it? ☎️⏰
Slack,0,0,@suhinini Thank you! We'll keep our eyes peeled. 👀🔎
Slack,0,0,@lucasmitchell Jeepers, we're so sorry, Lucas. 😢🚧 Would you mind writing in so we can take a closer look, please? https://t.co/WeWXcwsZIU
Slack,0,0,@persturesson Yay! Well done, super sleuth! 🎩🔎⭐️
Slack,1,0,@wintersweet Holy moly, that's a lot of emoji! 😂 Wild! 🐇🐁🐓
Slack,1,0,@femkesvs Hmm, could you please write in so we can take a closer look? https://t.co/WeWXcwsZIU 🕵️💌
Slack,1,0,@DigitalJazz You have exceptional taste, friend! Baking and maths, what a wonderful combination. 👌🍰🔢
Slack,0,0,@mHiSaN Ah, sorry. It sounds like you've run into a bug that we're currently investigating. 😞 What version of Slack do you have installed?
Slack,0,0,@argen Oh no, sorry! 😔 Do you find uploads fail on both wifi and mobile connections?
Slack,0,0,@ZeroDistraction Yikes, sorry! 🙀 How are they broken — missing settings or delayed messages? What version of Slack is installed? 🔍
Slack,0,0,@aoberoi @WadeWegner @ashevat @matvelloso 👋 Our pals at @SlackAPI might have some tips. 📚
Slack,1,1,@trionkidnapper @jen20 We do not look at or sell content to advertisers — it's just not in our business. 🙇👍
Slack,2,0,@DigitalJazz We see what you mean. 😐 We hope you'll learn to love the new, non-square icon! ✌️🐿
Slack,1,0,@ShawnHooper That's a great idea! We'll pass that on for further consideration. 📝🐕
Slack,0,0,@Tmonty1132 It would be great to offer this. Sadly, push notifications can only use your mobile's built-in options. We hope this may change✨
Slack,1,0,@securisec Absolutely, we'd be glad to pass that feature request along to the team! ✍️
Slack,0,0,@lucasmitchell We're sorry to hear that! Is there anything we can help with, or do you have any feedback for us? 📱
Slack,0,0,@securisec Posting permissions can be limited on the #general channel! More here: https://t.co/4BBFVkLKTA 🎒🐩
Slack,0,0,@ShawnChittle That's odd! Are you able to play other videos uploaded on desktop on your iOS? What happens if you switch networks? 🤔
Slack,1,1,@dgrandhay We're sorry you aren't loving the new icon! We hope it'll grow on you! 🌷
Slack,0,0,@suhinini That sounds odd - no changes on our end with emoji autocomplete. Can you write in to feedback@slack.com with some details? 📝🤔
Slack,0,0,@NugentCantileno 👋Hi there! We're sorry for the trouble. Only the channel creator and team owners/admins can rename it. Could that be why? 🤔
Slack,0,0,@ranachora108 Perhaps — group calls are available on Slack to paid teams: https://t.co/N42fbeCTKS.
Slack,1,0,@TumbaSherman It's not you, it's us. But once you begin typing, suggested channel matches will appear!
Slack,0,0,@theyonibomber Thanks for writing in — one of our specialists will get back to you asap.
Slack,1,0,@Wandelstock  Sometimes a little change doesn't hurt 😉
Slack,0,0,@daniel4hire  We recently retire the archive pages in Slack. We'll let the team know you'd like to see this reintroduced! 👌
Slack,1,0,@yoav85  Sorry for the trouble. Can you drop us a line at feedback@slack.com. We'd like to dig deeper for you. 🙏
Slack,0,0,@iTiamo  You're not alone in this one! We’re exploring this idea, so stay tuned.😃
Slack,0,0,@WadeWegner  We're happy to dig into this further for you! Please drop us a line feedback@slack.com
Slack,3,0,@Chesley @eli_schiff  Good eye! 🔎
Slack,10,1,@eli_schiff  Good eye! 🔍
Slack,1,0,@kubukoz  Sorry you feel that way! We'll let the team know that a square icon is an option you'd like to have.
Slack,1,0,@stephenhersee  Oh you know...magic and stuff. Thanks for ordering with us! 💥
Slack,1,0,@itsrichspicer Our security team is monitoring this situation & working  to find the best solution. Thank you for your patience!
Slack,1,0,@BOGA32_  We did get a little makeover! 💇
Slack,2,0,@botlistco   😉
Slack,0,0,@benjamin_payne Sorry for the shock! 😨
Slack,0,0,@osyoyu Sorry about the trouble. Deleting and reinstalling the app should help!
Slack,0,0,@WReynoldsYoung Yes, we are actively tracking this as a bug!
Slack,0,0,@WReynoldsYoung  We’re so sorry for the trouble. Our team is working to resolve this ASAP.
We're looking into this as we speak.
Slack,0,0,@samclarke 💗
Slack,0,0,@Mackolicious12  We sure do! Check out our London openings 👉 https://t.co/UzXwhFXn7i
Slack,1,0,@sajid9185  We're trying our hardest, but there's always room for improvement. We'll pass your feedback along!
Slack,0,0,@bhavinhjoshi Hmmm. Would you mind writing into us at feedback@slack.com? We'd like to take a deeper look for you. 🙏
Slack,0,0,@lexiatwork  😢
Slack,0,1,@ryanvarick We did! Gave it a lick of paint for summer. ☀️
Slack,0,0,@femkesvs If you press shift+esc, does that clear it? 🤔
Slack,0,0,@smad 🤔 That is true!
Slack,0,0,@woongy Single channel guests can only see the other members of the channel they're in. Hope that helps!
Slack,0,0,@Grossiaux Sorry! We'd recommend turning off notifications fully while you're away but a longer snooze might be good — we'll think on it!
Slack,0,0,@riking27 Drop a note to feedback@slack.com, we can help you there!
Slack,0,0,@Bl1zz You'll need an admin to remove a bot — can you write in to feedback@slack.com so we can help further?
Slack,0,0,@persturesson Ah yes, sorry for the frustration there! It's not possible to turn it off but we'll certainly pass that along to the team.
Slack,0,0,@skippedrecord No plans to change it back but we're listening to all feedback — thank you. 🙇
Slack,2,0,@xavierverdaguer 🤗
Slack,0,0,@thirdmandesign That's a nifty idea — thank you for sharing! We'll pass that on to the team. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@malonehedges We don't generally but if you can drop a note to feedback@slack.com, we'll reply as speedily as possible!
Slack,1,0,@_MattWelch_ We hope you had a great vacation! 😎
Slack,1,0,@joshicsin Thank you so much for the kind words! 💖
Slack,0,0,@gioismeyo Have you tried cmd/ctrl-[? Should do the trick! Along with cmd/ctrl-] to go forward.
Slack,0,0,@tatianatmac You can't, we're sorry to say. But we'll make a note of the idea. 📝
Slack,0,0,@farhanmohamed Ooh. Ok, that is strange. Do you mind dropping a note to feedback@slack.com so we can investigate further?
Slack,0,0,@NorthIsUp 🤐
Slack,0,0,@kjowong @SlackAPI 🙌
Slack,0,0,@GandalfsBaby Ah, we see what you mean. We'll share this with the team. Thanks!
Slack,0,0,@George_Kourdin Interesting idea 💡 We'll give this some thought, thank you!
Slack,0,0,@roisiproven Ah that's good to note. If you run into anything similar, please let us know. We'll keep an eye out! 👀
Slack,0,0,@dracos Excellent, thank you! Our team will be in touch soon to help sort this out. 🙏
Slack,0,0,@Bl1zz Hmm, was it Slackbot, or a different bot?
Slack,1,0,@plasticjinks Oh goodness, even with our typos! We meant to say "sorry to hear you're not a fan". Is it the weekend yet? 👀  PS- 💖  you, too!
Slack,0,0,@dracos Thanks— it definitely seems buggy. Could you send us your logs from the Help menu under "Show Logs in Finder" to feedback@slack.com
Slack,0,0,@JamesByrness Sorry to hear! Maybe next time 💫
Slack,0,0,@roisiproven Hmm, which version of the Slack app is it? Version 3.23 is our most recent one, and we haven't been able to reproduce this yet.
Slack,0,0,@plasticjinks We're sorry to hear it's not a fan of the new icon 😔  We appreciate the feedback!
Slack,0,0,@BrianWeaverOS You can do that with the #general channel! https://t.co/HuJF4TVdQO
Slack,0,0,@dracos How strange! Can we ask which version of the app you're on? You can check the number under Slack > About Slack in the MacOS menubar.
Slack,0,0,@memorie_holiday Well, we still think you're delightful. 💕
Slack,1,0,@ln_parker Thanks so much! Great thought— we'll see what we can do. 💡
Slack,1,0,@morid1n We're so sorry this has been so awful. We are trying to figure it out and wondered if you could write us at feedback@slack.com? 🙇
Slack,1,0,@tracypholmes We're feeling pretty good! We're taking turns with the weekend so we all get a chance to go enjoy. Thanks for thinking of us!
Slack,52,0,@mathowie >Get back to work.
Slack,0,0,@BrianWeaverOS Hmm that's not right! Could you drop us a line at feedback@slack.com so we can take a closer look? 🙏
Slack,63,23,If you're 
A) a developer and
B) in the Bay Area 
Then you should really
A) be following @SlackAPI already and/or… https://t.co/8xlNTwVGEE
Slack,1,0,@its_brookebell Anytime! Have a lovely time! 🎉☀️
Slack,1,0,@its_brookebell We did make a few small adjustments to align it with our other app icons! Sorry for the feelings of strangeness. ✨
Slack,0,0,@JosephRooks Hmm, could you try clearing the app's cache from the Help menu in the MacOS menu bar to see if that helps? We have a hunch.
Slack,0,0,@simplifyclarify We're really sorry to hear this. Can you share more about any specific issues you're running into that we can troubleshoot?
Slack,0,0,@megaroeny Mostly we've updated our icons across all our platforms for consistency 👍
Slack,0,0,@JosephRooks That is very odd! Is this behavior happening with any other menus, or only this one? Are you using an external mouse?
Slack,0,0,@JosephRooks Hmm, which dropdown would that be (what are you trying to change)? And which platform is this happening on?
Slack,0,0,@j_wolfyy We're delighted to hear that you think so! Thank you! ❤️
Slack,1,0,@RohitAlexander Why would we do that? @slack is a wonderful person.
Slack,0,0,@martinb3 @-here is limited to only those who are online right now. So the two options intentionally behave differently. 2/2
Slack,0,0,@martinb3 User groups are intended to notify everyone in the specific group regardless of whether they are currently online or not. 1/2
Slack,1,0,@megaroeny We've given the icon a little nip, tuck and cleaning up.
Slack,0,0,@martinb3 Are you getting these mentions when you've enabled Do Not Disturb? 2/2
Slack,0,0,@martinb3 User group mentions and @-mentions work the same way. So you shouldn't be getting one when you aren't getting the other. 1/2
Slack,0,0,@rcauvin We recently updated our iOS and Android icons.
Slack,0,0,@martinb3 Sorry, we don't quite understand. User groups are designed to notify each member of the group. You don't want that to happen?
Slack,2,0,@christieish 23 reacjis for Glen Coco! You go, Glen Coco. But no more than that, or it’s too many emoji. Bye!
Slack,0,0,@jcampbell_05 Thank you, it does sound like you've run into an iOS bug. We're very sorry for the trouble.
Slack,0,0,@roisiproven And which mobile platform did this happen on?
Slack,1,0,@psobot Thank you!
Slack,1,0,@ahernandezlopez If you're having trouble please get in touch at feedback@slack.com. Our iOS team will help.
Slack,0,0,@psobot That's certainly unexpected. Which platform did this happen on?
Slack,1,0,@roisiproven Hmmm, that's unexpected. Was it a particularly long username?
Slack,1,0,@dekaru  Nope! The manually uploaded avatar takes precedence. 📷
Slack,0,0,@sjeklinski Can you go into the main app menu and choose Help > Clear Cache and Restart? Any difference after that?
Slack,0,0,@matt_porter_ Sorry about that. It's a known issue we're working to improve.
Slack,0,0,@sjeklinski That's... not right. Did you recently change your system language? 🤔
Slack,0,0,@psobot Was it waiting as a draft when you had a connection again?
Slack,0,0,@EskilRyndarien Ahh, got it. That's not something we have planned right now, but it's an interesting idea! We'll pass it along. 📱➡️💻
Slack,0,0,@psmishra Thanks for letting us know about this! 😳
Slack,1,0,@dekaru Avatars uploaded manually after updating your gravatar should override your gravatar. 👍
Slack,3,1,@kylepkuo Our favourite Skrillex song is Bangarang. It’s a head banger(ang).
Slack,0,0,@MatGosselin 🙌
Slack,0,0,@PaulLomax We have, and we know change is hard, but we're here for you! 💖  Let us know if you have questions. feedback@slack.com
Slack,0,0,@morid1n We're so sorry about this! What specifically is plaguing you? We'll look into it.
Slack,1,0,@van_miranda Clever idea! 💡 We'll make sure the team takes a look.
Slack,0,0,@criscmaia No plans at the moment, but we can pass this along as a feature request!
Slack,0,0,@psobot Yikes, that's no good! 😨 To recap: You were in a DM, typed a message, and when you hit send, the message text just disappeared?
Slack,0,0,@criscmaia There's no way to see who deleted a message via the api. 🙃
Slack,0,0,@farhanmohamed On second thought, it looks like you might have toggled off "Include a preview" in your notification preferences (cmd-,).
Slack,0,0,@bpratdesaba Sorry about this! Please try hitting shift + esc, and let us know if that clears the badges. 🔕
Slack,1,0,@jstrauss We hear you, and we're looking into improving this! Thanks for your patience. 🙌
Slack,0,0,@MatGosselin No plans at this time, but we'll let the team know it's something you'd like to see!  🎶
Slack,1,0,@cjscheper Not everything needs to be round! But our app icon does. For now. 🔵
Slack,0,0,@jonnyzzz Oh no!  🤔By chance, were you using Slack on your desktop when these messages were sent?
Slack,0,0,@psmishra Hmm. How exactly are you initiating that call?
Slack,0,0,@DeborahLee89 😢This is a known bug we're trying to squash. 🐛 We'll let you know when we've fixed it. So sorry for the trouble right now! 🐛 🚧
Slack,1,0,@alikrausman We hear you, that'd be pretty neat. We'll share the idea with the team. 👯
Slack,0,0,@cdownie Good questions! 1. No good reason now, but it's something we're looking into. 2. Not currently, but leave the idea with us. 🤔
Slack,1,0,@heyyPJ Thank *you*! 🚀
Slack,2,0,@brendantnorris @charliedeets It is indeed like that in order to honor the team admin's security needs. We hear this a lot, though. 💭
Slack,0,0,@jcampbell_05  😭 You might be running into a known bug. 🐛 Which version of the Slack iOS app are you using? We'll check in with the team.
Slack,0,0,@ShadowmarN Change is difficult. We're here to help. ❤️
Slack,0,0,@tvanantwerp 💡 That's an idea! Thanks for sharing this with us!
Slack,1,0,@jcampbell_05 Yikes, we're sorry for the trouble. Could you let us know what you mean by lost your details? We'd like to investigate this. 🙇
Slack,1,0,@ScottSmith95 Just a little off the top! https://t.co/J3bTRrjgeU
Slack,1,0,@megankhenry Oh, that's usually when the good stuff's about to be posted! https://t.co/v6GNpmCnLT
Slack,1,0,@ben_seven Sorry about that! https://t.co/Hiy1BgB4C1
Slack,0,0,@ben_seven In the mobile apps it's not possible to do this — they're ordered alphabetically. However, we'll let the team know you want this!
Slack,0,0,@mossiodotco We don't have an in-built command, but there are several gif integrations — it may be one has been removed from your team.
Slack,1,0,@mpaarating It’s not currently on the roadmap, but we’ll consider it for the future. Thanks for the suggestion! 📝
Slack,0,0,@caschod You can always find one to suit your team on our App Directory: https://t.co/avX6I8dDcN. ✨
Slack,1,0,@shakerdev (But on a slightly more serious note, it's something that we've heard a lot of feedback about and are looking into!)
Slack,1,0,@shakerdev Cat...says...dark mode......must...have...dark mode — HEY! We see what you did there. Sneaky, using cats. 🐈
Slack,1,0,@HamidHCS Not about this, at least! 😉😘
Slack,1,0,@juliandoesstuff 🙈🙈🙈
Slack,0,0,@GeorgeAHallam At present users can DM any other team member they can see in Slack. We'll let the team know you'd like more control of this.
Slack,0,0,@AntonMihailov We hear you, and it's something we're looking to improve. In future, we hope for Comments to work more like Threads. 🎈
Slack,0,0,@theotherreceive Good thought — we really appreciate the feedback. Every little bit helps! 🌸
Slack,0,0,@GrandLogicInc Thank you for the feedback. We hear you — there's always room for improvement!
Slack,0,0,@PhABCD Oh no! It's not possible to remove the command, but if you can please write in to feedback@slack.com we can investigate this.
Slack,0,0,@FGRibreau If you'd like to have a chat about our plans, you can always write to us at feedback@slack.com! 🦋
Slack,1,0,@izi8000 It's nothing drastic, but we did have a minor makeover! 💅✨
Slack,2,0,@nicsmcnally @Techies4TS Orange is the new Slack!
Slack,0,0,@akhilgupta_me Many thanks! 🐖🌼🌳🌸🐔
Slack,0,0,@amaccuish Hmm, mind resetting the cache? If that doesn't help, drop us a line to feedback@slack.com and we can dig in deeper! 🤔🔎
Slack,1,0,@julegamache 🙌 Yay, we're so glad to hear that! We're always here if you need a hand.
Slack,0,0,@Level20EastGuy Oh, that's odd! If you drop us a line to feedback@slack.com we can take a look into this for you! 🙏
Slack,0,0,@dayle_design Eep, we have a known bug with overexcited spellcheckers that we're working on — sorry about this! 🐛
Slack,0,0,@julegamache Hmm, you should have the same experience — what exactly are you seeing on Windows? 🤔
Slack,1,0,@zistooshort You gotta do what you gotta do! 🦋
Slack,0,0,@HamidHCS Arf, we have a bug that we're trying to squash with this at the moment. Please bear with us! 🐛🐻
Slack,0,0,@ream88 💅😘💖
Slack,1,0,@bmeakin https://t.co/QxgOxPT5Zm
Slack,1,0,@galenking Interesting. That's certainly one we'll pass on to the team — thanks for the suggestion! 🌸
Slack,0,0,@ragnarkarlsson Alas, you can only have the order displays with newest at the bottom! We may give it more thought in future.
Slack,0,0,@villesundberg The App Store may sometimes be a little behind what with app approvals and the like. Sorry about that!
Slack,1,0,@admirim No, afraid not. It's not something that's on our roadmap at the minute but we'll be sure to pass your feedback onto the team here 📝
Slack,1,0,@robertgaal WE STILL THINK YOU'RE GREAT 💕
Slack,0,0,@smashman2004 We're on it! Sorry for the long wait. 🙌
Slack,1,0,@aviaryan123 If you go to https://t.co/oUb433Gxi1 and enter all email addresses you use, we'll send you a list of your accounts and teams!
Slack,1,0,@robertgaal Neat idea! We'll pass this along to the team for consideration.
Slack,0,0,@ysihaoy That's our pleasure! Also, sorry about the sudden change — we're trying to align our app icons across the board!
Slack,0,0,@villesundberg So sorry! Mind trying to see if a fresh install of v2.6.3 fixes this strange read state behavior? https://t.co/tqv3hLFP8X
Slack,0,0,@WazzaEdition It's still a thing! We're making an effort to align all the current app icons.
Slack,0,0,@prashantdilse Thanks for bearing with us! 💖
Slack,0,0,@prashantdilse Ah, sorry about this. We're currently tracking an issue with the read/unread state and hope to have this patched up soon. 🙏
Slack,0,0,@SahilC0 Thanks, friend! We quite like them, so we're glad to hear that you do too! 🎉🎉
Slack,0,0,@paulkarambo It's still a thing! Just trying to keep our app icons consistent across all platforms! ✨
Slack,1,0,@sydneyx Excellent, then you should be fine! There's some compression when uploading via iOS, but there's none on the desktop app. 😃
Slack,0,0,@PurelyScott We're sorry it's not your cup of tea! Time moves on and we must evolve! 🕰️
Slack,0,0,@jorilallo So, so sorry, Jori. We're fixing this as quickly as possible.
Slack,0,0,@maccaw Not at all, friend! We know it's a pain to deal with, and we're most certainly still working away at it. A fix is on its way! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@sydneyx In most cases, yes! Images will stay at their original resolution. From which devices are you uploading and downloading from?
Slack,1,0,@tyler_hedrick Good eyes. 😼
Slack,0,0,@farhanmohamed That's strange! There should be a title next to 'uploaded this image'. What version is your Mac app? We haven't made changes!
Slack,0,0,@KingsdsNetwork We're always thinking about our native invite features, considering the best balance between speed and keeping teams secure.
Slack,2,0,@rena_tom Welcome to the future! The coffee here is pretty good. 👌☕️
Slack,1,0,@M_c_Ruer Ah, our apologies! 😞🐛 We're looking into an issue where the app gets a bit bogged down by large chunks of Unicode. So sorry! 👾
Slack,0,0,@galenking Hmm, if a channel hasn't had any activity for a set period of time? 🤔📝
Slack,0,0,@dstrelau Oh gosh, we didn't mean to cause a fuss! 🙈 It was just time for some spring cleaning. Summer/winter cleaning? 🤔🤷‍♀️🛁
Slack,0,0,@dalefraser We'll pass your request to the team. Thank you for sharing. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@E3Writing No lightweight version sorry. Though we'll pass this across to the team. Setting your message display to compact might help? 🙇
Slack,0,0,@The_JoshOConnor No, YOU ARE! ⛷💐🏌
Slack,3,0,@saraclay15 We did give it a bit of a spruce. Nice catch! 🎣🏆
Slack,1,0,@JoeyEC We jazzed it up a little. 😉🎷🎺💃
Slack,2,0,@paulcanetti ✨😊🏂
Slack,0,0,@zegolf ✨✨🔮✨✨
Slack,0,0,@mattyohe Glad you dig it! 😍✨⛷
Slack,0,0,@psomebody 🍦+👕 =😭😭😭😭😭
Slack,1,0,@hkdobrev Yep, gotcha. More customizability around the sidebar features is on our radar. Thanks for sharing! ✨😊🏄
Slack,0,0,@CryptoRacer Are you running into connectivity trouble across your team? Please let us know and we'll look into it! 🙌
Slack,0,0,@zegolf We sure did! Nice catch. 👌🏻
Slack,0,0,@ben_thenwecan Why hello there, Ben! Are you looking for information about our plans? If so, please see: https://t.co/JB8bKiRisj. 😀
Slack,0,0,@haynes The app icon you mean? Heh, sorry. We did tweak it just a little. 🙈
Slack,0,0,@mommyguru Hmm, are you redirected to your team if you head to https://t.co/nqZzB7wTUL? 🤔
Slack,0,0,@lyspeth Thanks for the feedback, Alexis. It's not possible to make this optional, however, we'll share your comments with our team. 👍🏼
Slack,0,0,@ericcbin Sorry for the hassle! Reducing the number of teams you're signed into may help. If not, please drop us a line: feedback@slack.com.
Slack,0,0,@tonywhitelive Oh! An interactive zebra, now that's an idea! We're sorry to say that's not on our roadmap at this time. 🙈
Slack,0,0,@farhanmohamed Hmm, do you mind clarifying what thing we're talking about and the operating system? 🙌
Slack,1,1,@codilicious 💅🏼 ✨
Slack,0,0,@lambrocalrisian You're on the ball! ⚾️
Slack,0,0,@danhaddock_irl Thanks for the feedback! We'll let the Android team know. 💕
Slack,1,0,@ktzhu We're sorry for the continued trouble. We may need to help out here. Could you write in to feedback@slack.com? We'll take a look! 👀
Slack,0,0,@eriinh We recommend that you invite others to your team. Maybe you can invite some bots to your team and they can help the conversation?🙈
Slack,0,0,@E3Writing And more then 14,000x times as big as good ol' 1K ZX Chess! We're spoiled these days, really. 👑
Slack,0,0,@psomebody What kind of ice cream? 🤔
Slack,0,0,@ktzhu Oh no! This looks to be a bug. Did you just update to 3.22? If so, could you try deleting and reinstalling the app? 🙏🏽
Slack,0,0,@failvarez Nothing that should have caused anything like that! Is the slowdown only affecting certain actions, or everything in your team? 🤔
Slack,0,0,@SarahKSquire That's quite a lot of tabs: our desktop apps might be a good alternative in that case. Were they not a good fit for you?
Slack,0,0,@fchevitarese That's good to hear! Hopefully we'll be able to lend a hand from there. Thanks for your patience.
Slack,0,0,@The_JoshOConnor Oh, consolidation of those alerts would make a lot of sense, even just as an option! We'll mention this to our iOS team. 🔕📱
Slack,0,0,@lambrocalrisian Ah, yes, we did indeed change our icon a little in the latest iOS release. Good eye! Hopefully you still like it? 😅
Slack,1,0,@MattNavarra  I'm afraid we cannot view your team this way. Please write in to our team and we will investigate further for you! 🔎
Slack,1,0,@MattNavarra We aren't seeing any issues on our end. Please write to feedback@slack.com with your team details and we'll take a closer look.
Slack,2,0,@notnownikki Great suggestion here! We’re exploring this idea, so stay tuned.💡
Slack,0,0,@SirOpsALot That would be sensible. Thanks for sending this idea our way! We'll pass it along to the team. ⭐
Slack,1,0,@tweets_so_fresh Not quite a hotkey but just in case it helps there is a slash command: /mute
Slack,0,0,@cryonnetwork If it was unwanted we’d recommend speaking with your team admin about that team member. 2/2
Slack,0,0,@cryonnetwork From the screenshot it looks like someone on your team set a reminder for you. 1/2
Slack,0,0,@Hayotje Is it not appearing for you somewhere it should?
Slack,1,0,@techno_goober 🙈
Slack,0,0,@RegLevy Do you have a link to one of those notes? We will clear up the confusion there.
Slack,0,0,@RegLevy You can drag the team icons to rearrange them in the desktop app.
Slack,0,0,@RegLevy Although we’re unable to implement every feature request, we truly appreciate receiving these requests.
Slack,0,0,@fchevitarese We're sorry to hear about the trouble. Please write to feedback@slack.com so our team can look into this.
Slack,0,0,@Skarin We'll let the team know this is something you'd really like to see soon!
Slack,1,0,@SanderBlue It's not there by default, but you can certainly add it to your team. We'll just leave this here... https://t.co/Tly0GdV0H8 🙃
Slack,1,0,@ivancantarino We're so glad you like them!
Slack,0,0,@PmPyne Unless a Team Owner has explicitly restricted message editing to within a timeframe, you should be able to: https://t.co/SjowN44RdN
Slack,1,0,@jmxd_ You are not going crazy. We tweaked it just a tad. 🌈
Slack,0,0,@feldman Anytime! Have a wonderful day! 💖
Slack,0,0,@stuartpreston Great! ✨
Slack,0,0,@stuartpreston Ah, there is no 24-hour Do not disturb mode. You could change your notifications to "Nothing" though! 💡
Slack,2,2,@kylepkuo Shaquille O'Neal, the great NBA(nana) player.
Slack,0,0,@MattEnth 😱 We're so sorry for the persistent All Threads badge. That is our best workaround. We're trying to squash this bug for good. 🐛🔨
Slack,1,0,@IanScarffe And turning off Prefs > Accessibility > Allow Animated Images/Emoji can help, as these can be CPU hungry processes. 2/2
Slack,1,0,@IanScarffe Yum eggs, but also yikes! Sorry. Logging out of unused teams, as well as turning off Prefs > Inline Media & Links settings 1/2
Slack,0,0,@brygibbs We are hiring! Take a gander at our careers page! https://t.co/UzXwhFXn7i
Slack,1,0,@gcerquant Sorry for the confusion, that's a totally reasonable expectation. We'll pass the feedback along to the team.
Slack,0,0,@MrAdamBullock 😭 This is a known and terribly frustrating bug. We're doing our best to resolve this as soon as we can.🐛 🛠
Slack,0,0,@dansteif Nothing new to report, sorry. Read receipts aren't something on our immediate roadmap, but we're always listening to feedback!
Slack,0,0,@abigailzdg As in a :wtf: emoji? You can make custom emojis for your team! https://t.co/WH6XJUssDX
Slack,0,0,@jcedborger Definitely something we think about. We'll pass your suggestion along. Thanks for the feedback!
Slack,1,0,@jaysonwhelpley Yup, there is a way! In Preferences > Messages & Media > uncheck "Show images and files from linked websites." ✨
Slack,0,0,@feldman You may ignore @-channel and @-here in channel-specific notification preferences! @-mentions cannot be muted. Hope this helps!
Slack,0,0,@treycausey Yikes, so sorry about this! Could you write to feedback@slack.com? We want to investigate this for you. 🙏
Slack,0,0,@brygibbs This isn't possible at this time, but this is a neat idea! We'll share this with the team. ✌
Slack,0,0,@treycausey Let us know how this goes too. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@treycausey 😭 This is a known bug on iOS. Could you clear your cache for us? Open Slack and swipe left to Settings > Advanced > Reset Cache.
Slack,1,0,@FierceDaily In Windows you can use their built in Speech Recognition: https://t.co/FGIw9l2YT2
Slack,0,0,@tuck183 ...team, Slack stops automatically populating that list. 2/2
Slack,0,0,@tuck183 That's essentially how it works, yes. The list only shows up to 23 DMs at a time, so once there are a lot of members in the... 1/2
Slack,0,0,@comzeradd  We see what you mean. Thanks for sharing this feedback!
Slack,0,0,@tuck183 But new members will still show up there when they join on smaller teams.
Slack,0,0,@tuck183 Actually, If you hover over the members in left bar, do you see an ( x ) beside the names? You should be able to close those DMs.
Slack,0,0,@VisionWebSoft Would you mind dropping a note to feedback@slack.com so we can dig in a bit into what might be going on? Sorry about that!
Slack,0,0,@tuck183 There aren't any features in the paid plans that would help with that specifically, we're afraid, but we'll pass this feedback on.
Slack,0,0,@jcedborger Something we're considering, for sure. Are you imagining them grouped for the whole team, or by each person's choice?
Slack,0,0,@FierceDaily We just mean the ones built into your phone/device/computer, such as Dictation on Mac and iOS.
Slack,0,0,@RonellSharee Your mobile apps will then default to that option as well. Hope that helps! 2/2
Slack,0,0,@RonellSharee If you're using the desktop app, you can click the 'skin tone' button in the emoji picker to set your default skin tone. 1/2
Slack,0,0,@tehtrav Hmm… haven't heard of that one before. Would you mind writing in to feedback@slack.com with some details so we can investigate?
Slack,0,0,@PrestoD That goes to the same place, yes! Thanks, and our team will investigate. Again, our apologies. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@EskilRyndarien Hmm, so you mean logging in remotely from your desktop? 🤔 (Or are the links not working on your phone perhaps?)
Slack,0,0,@IAmNotCyril https://t.co/iJRl607a1H
Slack,0,0,@IAmNotCyril Sorry. 😢
Slack,1,0,@fUZZItweets Oh no! We're sorry to hear it. If it continues, could you please send us a report through "Help" in your app's menu?
Slack,0,0,@PrestoD That's most odd, so sorry! Do you mind dropping a note to feedback@slack.com so we can investigate further? 🔍
Slack,2,0,@danfairs So sorry! We're working hard to improve this — it's a top priority for the team right now. Please do bear with us!
Slack,0,0,@brianfagioli It is! We updated the icon in the latest release 😊
Slack,0,0,@tuck183 In which case they will see any members who are also in the channels they are in 2/2
Slack,0,0,@tuck183 We're afraid it's not possible to prevent new users from seeing the full team directory unless they are guest users 1/2
Slack,0,0,@tuck183 Ah! We have a help guide on organizing your sidebar:  https://t.co/ycGBnj9Njr. You can set it so that just unread material appears!
Slack,0,0,@chuise Hmm, have you tried resetting the cache at any point by any chance? This can sometimes help when the issue is in the app only 🙏
Slack,0,0,@tuck183 We generally ask that more detailed requests please go to /feedback or feedback@slack.com. Thanks!
Slack,0,0,@tuck183 We'd just like to clarify, are you referring to the members list within channels or was it something else?
Slack,0,0,@mattgawarecki Thanks for the idea! We will share that with the team 🙌
Slack,0,0,@rudyrichter We've changed that to cmd+shift+enter based on user feedback (people found themselves pressing it too much by mistake)!
Slack,0,0,@chuise Sounds like you're having some connectivity troubles. We're sorry 😞 Is this happening on the app, the browser, or both perhaps?
Slack,0,0,@feldman This is so that you don't lose visibility of messages that could be important for you to see while your channels are muted.
Slack,0,0,@JudithStr From the app you can type /feedback, or else you can email feedback@slack.com. Thanks so much :)
Slack,1,0,@marcelokanzaki Sorry for this inconvenience, this is a known bug we're currently working on. We hope you can bear with us a little longer 🙏
Slack,0,0,@SynteZZZ We're sorry! We'd like to discuss further with you though and could do with some more room 🙏Will do our very best to help :)
Slack,0,0,@bangasho We'll certainly pass this feedback on for you! Sorry that we don't offer the UX you're looking for right now Omair.
Slack,0,0,@DCDoughnut You'll have to be an Admin or Owner! Here are the instructions to do so:  https://t.co/qXilN9LNyX
Slack,0,0,@JudithStr 😱We'd love to troubleshoot this and get some more detail if you don't mind. Could you please reach out to /feedback? Thanks! 🙏
Slack,0,0,@adamgriffiths A little bit plumper, yes! 😊
Slack,0,0,@giromide We did!
Slack,0,0,@SynteZZZ Oof, that sounds like a known bug we're working on. If you drop a line to feedback@slack.com we'll see what we can do. 🐛
Slack,0,0,@dmilith We understand the navigation can be frustrating — we'll try to do this better the next time around. Thank you for your patience.
Slack,0,0,@camellia_will https://t.co/BNwVVra8Hh
Slack,1,0,@Inversal_svq @myetherwallet Sorry to hear this! If you can write in to feedback@slack.com we can take a closer look at this issue.
Slack,0,0,@jonmcp 🙌✨
Slack,0,0,@RussellHMSmith Alas, without resorting to a game of Whispers, there's no other way to do this right now — sorry!
Slack,1,0,@weekstweets Aw shucks, we try! 🌸💖
Slack,0,0,@jonmcp Oops! We made some changes, but you should be able to do this using cmd + shift + return. Sorry for the confusion. 🙈
Slack,0,0,@RussellHMSmith The best option is to create a new private channel and invite everyone else in! 🎈🍰
Slack,0,0,@dcondrau Yikes. If you don't mind writing in to feedback@slack.com we can take a closer look for you!
Slack,0,0,@kennydude  Disappearing? Gosh, that's not good. Can you please write to us at feedback@slack.com so we can take a closer look? 🔎
Slack,1,0,@MrLoh Ah, that's a good catch! We'll take a look to see if we can update it there too. Thanks for sharing! 😄
Slack,0,0,@prayas26 Ah, would you mind terribly writing in to feedback@slack.com so we can troubleshoot further? 🔎 🙇
Slack,1,0,@kostas_menu Thanks for being honest, we'll share this with the team! 🙏
Slack,0,0,@lukejdarling Great to hear! Don't hesitate to reach back out if you run into any other issues.
Slack,0,0,@OrfulComics  It’s not sad. It’s lovely! As are you! ❤️  Oh, and the leprechauns. They have a wonderful way with words 📓
Slack,0,0,@SynteZZZ If you navigate to Slack on your desktop and click "shift-esc" here, this should clear things on your Android app. 🤞
Slack,0,0,@kennydude Hmm, are you looking to view all threads at once? Or to have a specific thread viewable just by you? 🤔
Slack,0,0,@dcondrau Hmm, apologies for the frustration! If you click "shift-esc" when you're in a channel (and not in All Threads), does it clear? 🤞
Slack,0,0,@productoven Gosh, that's so wonderful to hear! Thank you for sharing , it really makes us smile! ☺️ 🤗
Slack,1,0,@rogehsworld We're definitely considering our options here. We want to make sure we make use of this feature n the best way. ✨ 🙇
Slack,0,0,@kostas_menu We're working to unify our app icons across the board. If you have any feedback, don't hesitate to let us know! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@lukejdarling Oh no, Luke! That's not good. Can you let me know which app this is happening on? 🔎
Slack,0,0,@IanScarffe  We've some tips that can help! Can you please send us a note to feedback@slack.com? We'd love to help you with this!
Slack,0,0,@pabbalca Great catch! We did make a small change. Hopefully it's easier on the eye. 😉
Slack,0,0,@interestingmix There isn't but if you write in to feedback@slack.com, we might have some similar suggestions. 📝  🙇
Slack,0,0,@pabbalca Hmm, what appears to be different? 🔎  👀
Slack,0,0,@aayanzillis We'll pass this along as a feature request to the team here. Thank you! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@_JasonMurray Thanks for letting us know Jason! We'll share that feedback with the team here. 💕
Slack,0,0,@stephencrowther We made changes to the icon on Android and iOS. Sorry to hear you preferred the old one better. We'll let the team know! 🙇

Slack,0,0,@apiousman Thanks for the kind words! 🔗
Slack,0,0,@ekettoz Gotcha - we're definitely aware of some cases where channels/DMs do not immediately update as 'read'. We hope this is fixed soon! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@johncaffeine Makes sense! 😂
Slack,0,0,@ekettoz Sorry about this, Tom! Mind letting us know which app and version you and the team are seeing this occur on?
Slack,0,0,@jeremybeasley Oh, are you seeing this occur when searching within the same Slack team or when switching between different teams? 🔍
Slack,1,0,@emilyooo Well then! Naw, you're not going crazy. We gave the icon a little polish with the latest update! 🕵🏻‍♀️
Slack,0,0,@johncaffeine Ah, gotcha! For now, providing different alignment options aren't currently on the roadmap, but we hear ya, John!
Slack,1,0,@dinchamion 😼🏏
Slack,111,7,@KarlTheFog Fun fact: Slack HQ has a meeting room named for you. Bunch of small ones named after 'hoods. And then a… https://t.co/fUz3ZNCLbX
Slack,0,0,@nirexx Strange! Is the person mentioned holding a guest account? Drop us some details and we'll investigate: https://t.co/WeWXcwsZIU 🔍
Slack,0,0,@nexon That's not good enough. 😔 Could you drop us a note via Settings > Submit Feedback? We'll look into it.
Slack,1,0,@kate_ugh Yay! Sorry for the oddness but just give us a shout if it's still wonky. 🙌
Slack,0,0,@johncaffeine Well maybe not an interesting one but: we think it looks clean! Is there a reason you'd find aligning other way better? 💫
Slack,0,0,@interestingmix Ah, gotcha! We're afraid they won't get an email unless they've subscribed to email notifications. Sorry about that!
Slack,1,0,@kate_ugh That's odd! Does a reinstall offer you a prompt to enable notifications on your phone?
Slack,0,0,@caiocooter 🙈 Sorry to hear that! Do you mind dropping us a note at https://t.co/WeWXcwsZIU? We'll help!
Slack,1,0,@grumpygamer Thank you for the kind words! For the record, we could never be mad at you. 💓
Slack,0,0,@johncaffeine We don't have a particular reason, but thanks for the feedback! It's something we can think about. 💭
Slack,0,0,@interestingmix If they have the channel muted they will still see a badged notification next to the channel name.
Slack,1,0,@CCSMrThompson 🙇 Sorry about that! You should have seen the option if your team creator had specified using Slack for school initially.
Slack,0,0,@interestingmix By default all users in a team are in the #general channel, so this would send a notification to everyone in the team.
Slack,0,0,@interestingmix You could drop an "@channel" message in the #general channel kindly asking users to delete any private channels.
Slack,0,0,@firstheart42 Ah! Slash commands can only be made directly from the app for now — sorry for the disappointment! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@dontrebootme @yvov Sorry about this! Does Shift + Esc help to remove the badge? (Warning: this will clear all your unreads!)
Slack,1,0,@ComplicitOwl Ah, apologies, we were looking at the desktop app. It'd be nice if everything matched, we'll take a look. 👀
Slack,1,0,@victorkernes 😘
Slack,0,0,@stantonk We appreciate this isn't always handy and we'll give it some more thought. Sorry, friend! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@stantonk Yes, we're afraid this setting can only be adjusted after the multi-party DM gets started.
Slack,0,0,@ComplicitOwl Hmm, we see an Oxford comma in the list of users when we hover over a reacji. 🤔 Could you send a screenshot, please?
Slack,1,0,@victorkernes We're so pleased you like it! 🙌🖼
Slack,1,0,@brettgodfrey Oh, Brett! You're making us blush. 😊🌹
Slack,0,0,@crouhana Sorry for the change! This update brings it in line with the other app icons, so we're all matching. 👯👯‍♂️
Slack,0,0,@HeckYeahMan Nice. 😬📸🍔
Slack,0,0,@stantonk By default, we only push mentions or keywords. To change, tap the DM name, then choose Notifications > All new messages.
Slack,0,0,@stantonk Ah, yes, actually! 💡 Multi-party DM notifications are more like channel notifications.
Slack,0,0,@gifkeyboard Yikes! 🔥🐕🔥
Slack,6,0,@Backdoorcook A dark/night theme for Slack? We hear you and we're giving it some thought. 🌙
Slack,2,0,@SeanLagged Gosh, you're very welcome! 🤗 Thank YOU for reading them!
Slack,1,0,@mgriffiss We hear you and we'll let the team know that you'd like to see this in Slack. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@altcoinio Nope — admins are just like everyone else here. They can view their own reminders and channel reminders. 🗓✅
Slack,1,0,@ideafella 😅 Slack pun aside... Thanks, friend! 🤗
Slack,110,8,We're happy to report that all users should be able to access their teams once more. We appreciate you sticking with us on this one. 🙇 💖🙌
Slack,0,0,@EWDurbin We're pretty sure it's the same size as all the others… 🤔📐
Change can be startling, we hope it becomes the new normal soon. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@raulriera Why, thank you! 📱💅✨
Slack,0,0,@EWDurbin Jarring because it's brand new and a little bit different? 😬

Slack,0,0,@ssuleman Hurrah! Thanks so much for bearing with us. 🐻💝
Slack,1,0,@meg_quintero Phew, excellent news! 👏 Thank you for being patient with us. 💖

Slack,0,0,@robbiegarvey Yikes! We're so sorry, Robbie. We're looking into it right now. 🚧
Slack,1,0,@LBKinson That emoji is part of an updated set that we don't yet support. Sorry! We're working on it! 🏃🏽‍♀️💨
Slack,0,0,@interestingmix No, there's no way to see how much storage space an individual user is taking up. We're sorry for the inconvenience here.
Slack,0,0,@AyaAkl @DeborahLee89 @FriendlyTester You can double check the version from your Slack "Settings" > "About".
Slack,0,0,@AyaAkl @FriendlyTester @DeborahLee89 Oh no! Hmmm. Could you check to see what version of the Slack app you're running? We're on 3.22 now.
Slack,0,0,@bibulb It'd certainly have some handy uses! Thanks for taking the time to reach out, we'll be sure to pass your feedback through. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@FriendlyTester @DeborahLee89 Ack, sorry! Richard's idea could work. You can also clear the cache from Settings > Advanced > Reset Cache.
Slack,0,0,@interestingmix Unfortunately there's no way to access privately-shared files that are not your own, we're afraid. Even as a team admin. 😓

Slack,1,0,@FabulousRice Thanks for the feedback. We'll definitely think about it! 😅
Slack,1,1,@drbrain @austinspires We changed the shortcut a while back for consistency reasons, but ⌘ + Shift + Enter should still do the trick! 🎩 🐰
Slack,0,0,@TicTacTia Hi! We're currently looking into these bugs – are you noticing this is only happening on iOS? Or do you use Mac or Windows too?
Slack,0,0,@davepermen Thanks! It's a highly requested feature, and we're considering how to make it best work with Slack's other moving parts. 🛠
Slack,5,0,@Hacker_Horse Ooooh. Thanks for letting us know you'd like to see AWK syntax highlighting in snippets. We've made a note of it. 📝
Slack,0,0,@IanDeRanieri There's a setting to enable GIF previews instead of just auto-sending. Ask your team admin! They can enable GIPHY previews. 😉
Slack,0,0,@firstheart42 Hmm, we have a known bug with *any* type of reply from Mac desktop alerts. Do other non-slash command replies work for you? 🤔
Slack,0,0,@betacar No trouble at all! You know where to find us if there's anything else we can do to help! 🐧
Slack,1,0,@rajashree_28 Oh, hey! Glad to hear you figured it out. 👏🏼
Slack,1,0,@alex_casalboni We use Javascript to rewrite the favicon URL. Rewriting the URL is enough to cause the browser to change the image!
Slack,0,0,@DylanCahoon9 Oh no! Would you be able to uninstall/reinstall the app? It should work just fine with a fresh install! 🌱
Slack,0,0,@RedYetiCo Oh no, indeed! 🙀 Our apologies! Can you please send a note to slackshop@slack.com so we can sort this out? 📝
Slack,0,0,@marooned1979 Holy moly, /remind us to stop blushing after reading this. 😍
Slack,1,0,@corinamanea Oh dear that's not so great! Could you please write in so we can get details? feedback@slack.com
Slack,1,0,@VincentColavin Not at the moment, sorry! We see how that could be handy though. We'll share this with the team for some consideration. 💖
Slack,0,0,@petematheson ...the app should fix things up. So sorry for the trouble, though. 🙅🐛 2/2
Slack,0,0,@petematheson Rats, you're running into a pesky bug that we're working to fix right now. In the meantime, uninstalling & reinstalling... 1/2
Slack,0,0,@altcoinio No plans to share at the moment but we'll happily pass your feedback on to the team! Thanks for sending your thoughts our way.💌
Slack,1,0,@BuskerOne Good grief! It may help to clear your cache – head to Help> Clear Cache & Restart from the top menubar of the screen to do this.✨
Slack,0,0,@altcoinio No, unfortunately not. 😶
Slack,0,1,@altcoinio It's not possible to delete other users' personal Slackbot reminders. Sorry for the bad news! 🤖
Slack,0,0,@BuskerOne Yikes, that doesn't right! Where are you seeing the "flash effect"? On the App Icon, or in the app itself? 🤔⚡️
Slack,0,0,@colindean Brilliant! Have you looked for something like this in the App Directory? https://t.co/h4YLd6QGDp
Slack,0,0,@Veidit Aah, that's very kind. Thank you. 💛
Slack,2,0,@fedesaraviab Typing "M" should toggle mute on and off. Take a look at the "Call Actions" section here for others! https://t.co/xlNiIVucEr
Slack,0,0,@Frngtstc Ah, we see. Can the integration be un-muted on your side? As for tweets unfurling like normal websites, we'll pass that along.
Slack,1,0,@claren Our security team is looking in to this, apologies for the trouble!
Slack,2,0,@oliverdunk_ Sort of like `@here` but for user groups. Not possible at the moment but certainly an interesting idea. We'll pass it along! 📝
Slack,3,1,@yarnaesthetic Your company is truly EGGSellent when it comes to puns. Quite impressed. 👏 🍳 👏 🍳 👏
Slack,0,0,@Frngtstc You'll need to authenticate a Twitter account to see previews. Do you have an account connected here? https://t.co/LYMfpKy1XG
Slack,0,0,@betacar Gah! Sorry! We've seen a few reports of this and working on a fix. Is your Slack zoom set at 100%? (Preferences > Accessibility)
Slack,0,0,@howdyasser Thanks for the idea! We don't have any plans for this at the moment, but we'll share this will our team for future thought! 🚀
Slack,0,0,@betacar Oh no not that! Could you try refreshing or resetting your app data and see if that helps? Otherwise, feedback@slack.com?
Slack,1,0,@adampatterson You can delete files from inactive from https://t.co/7NUNu6dTjS, and the team is carefully considering other options.
Slack,1,0,@_brotzky Thank you for letting us know, Dennis! We really appreciate it. We'll fix this bug! ☺️ 🐛
Slack,2,0,@thisischandresh @reallykristi 💖
Slack,1,0,@dgrandhay We hear you, Dorian! We'll pass this feedback with our team. 🙌 💡

Slack,0,0,@CryptoFR Sorry to hear about the trouble! It's not possible to remove @-mentions in reminders. We'll pass along the feature request though.
Slack,0,0,@mboylevt Hey Matt! There isn't a way to bulk delete channels. We'll let our team know that this is a feature you'd like to see! 🙏🏽
Slack,0,0,@dgrandhay Ah yes. Deactivated user files are included in your team's total file storage.
Slack,0,0,@celinasays Darn! Can you please write in to feedback@slack.com so we can try to clear it from the backend? 🙇
Slack,0,0,@absolutejam Interesting thought! 🤔 For now, you can start a thread and label it as NSFW, then thread the replies to keep them hidden.
Slack,0,0,@kirabug There's no way to reorder teams on mobile right now, but we'll let the team know you'd like to see that in the future! 📱
Slack,0,0,@IanScarffe Sorry about this! We're working on several improvements to reduce our resource consumption. How many teams are you logged into?
Slack,0,0,@eadnams That sure sounds broken! Our team would like to investigate – do you mind writing us at feedback@slack.com? Thanks! 🚂🔧
Slack,0,0,@DrDemondBledsoe Our Enterprise Grid product supplies the environment for HIPAA compliance. Reach out via https://t.co/5HugwdQQfF for info!
Slack,0,0,@mominawahab Glad it's working now! Please let us know if the issue returns.
Slack,0,0,@roach_iam We use Code Mirror for snippet support, so if it's not already in there, you're welcome to contribute!:  https://t.co/8MdmFiAm3j
Slack,1,0,@alex_casalboni Depending on your browser, yep! Anywhere the favicon is supposed to appear, we try to make it swap appropriately. ✨
Slack,0,0,@yvov Sorry that didn't prove to be a permanent fix! Please write in to feedback@slack.com so we can clear it for you from the backend. 🙇
Slack,1,0,@thisischandresh We're reading it! It sounds like a really fun idea. 😊🎬🌟
Slack,1,0,@jakobbrowning Afraid not, and we're sorry about that. We're working on a solution for this problem in the future! 🌴😴
Slack,0,0,@balonester It is a great spot to draft (and proofread!) complicated messages, too.
Slack,1,0,@__joshblack It is! Click on your username > Leave this team, then confirm and restart the app.
Slack,1,0,@jrrickard @laura_eurich Shift+Esc is not quite one button, but might work for you!
Slack,2,0,@team_salim Kindof curious about that other 10% now...
Slack,1,1,@UNCWseahawksFEM Glad to hear it! We are happy to help if you have questions.
Slack,0,0,@traviswill Let us know if we can help!
Slack,0,0,@liamsomerville Consolidated logins aren't on the roadmap for security and administrative reasons but thank you for the feedback! 🔐
Slack,0,0,@DeborahLee89 Oh no! Can you drop us a note to feedback@slack.com please? Our iOS team would love to take a closer look. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@DeborahLee89 So sorry! Can you swipe left into Settings > Advanced > Reset Cache to see if that clears it?
Slack,0,0,@fuzzybinary There is indeed! It requires a few steps so drop us a line to feedback@slack.com and we'll walk you through it. 👍
Slack,0,0,@voxpelli ...automatically suppress notifications for the timeframe that you choose until you turn off that feature. 2/2
Slack,0,0,@voxpelli We don't offer a mute option right now for several days/weeks. Sorry! The DnD feature only works per 24h, so it will... 1/2
Slack,0,0,@DCDoughnut That's across all OS.
Slack,0,0,@dgrandhay We hear you. If your team needs file storage space, you can ask team members to delete unused files from https://t.co/7NUNu6dTjS
Slack,0,0,@voxpelli No vacation mode, but you can update your DnD settings for your work teams so that you won't receive any notifications from them.
Slack,0,0,@DCDoughnut We retired the web view of message archives. Archives are now only viewable within the app.
Slack,0,0,@atif089 Afraid not, sorry! Permissions for @mentions can be changed at team-level only.
Slack,0,0,@mominawahab Is this happening on different browsers? What results do you get when running the self-help test at https://t.co/5gmpOHU2Rn?
Slack,0,0,@Rems0511 Afraid not, sorry! Private files of deactivated members stay truly private and cannot be accessed or deleted by other members.
Slack,0,0,@ebuie :-)
Slack,0,0,@EmTobey No set plans right now, but we'll pass your feedback along on this Emily!
Slack,1,0,@rubenschulz Ah, unfortunately if you're only in one team, there's no shortcut to open the chat window. We'll pass this idea to the team.
Slack,0,0,@rubenschulz Hmm, are you signed in to multiple teams, or only one? What version of the app are you using?
Slack,1,0,@YAlessandri Ahh, we do have some steps that might resolve this issue! Mind sending us a note to feedback@slack.com to discuss further?
Slack,0,0,@yvov Do you mind trying the keyboard shortcut: shift+esc and let us know if that successfully clears that notification for you? 🤞
Slack,0,0,@Firesphere 2/2....but we don't have any further details or ETA on that. We'll pass this along to the team on your behalf! 🤞
Slack,0,0,@Firesphere Not at the moment, sorry. We're currently looking at whether this is something that can be implemented in future....1/2
Slack,1,0,@paaast Yes, we're afraid this is a known issue :( Using the + icon in the message bar is the best way to upload files for now. So sorry! 💛
Slack,1,0,@JulesMariano Thanks for taking the time to let us know you'd like to see this feature! We'll pass it to the relevant team on your behalf ✍️
Slack,0,0,@HenningFemmer Great! Have a lovely day 🌈 ☀️
Slack,0,0,@hypnoboutique Hey! We welcome all feedback at Slack so please do feel free to send this to feedback@slack.com 🌟
Slack,1,0,@DirkAntonvM We'd love to investigate this further! Can you send us a note to feedback@slack.com and we'll see what might be happening? 👍
Slack,0,0,@wirosky Hmmm, what's the error you're seeing when you try to sign in? Do you have any screenshots you can share maybe?
Slack,1,0,@adymady29 You're very welcome! ❤️
Slack,0,0,@RvRoo So sorry, this is a known issue that our team are working to resolve. Mind logging this with our team at feedback@slack.com? 🙏
Slack,0,0,@hjbme Slackbot DM's can get mixed up with all your other messages from Slackbot. Here's some further information! https://t.co/F83sbExo8j
Slack,0,0,@josephheenan Sorry again. If you'd like to write in to feedback@slack.com we can share some tips that may help improve things 🤞
Slack,1,0,@HenningFemmer It's a known issue we're working on right now. Deleting the app and reinstalling should fix things up for you. Sorry! 🙏
Slack,1,0,@adymady29 Team invites are managed by team admins. Youll need to get in touch with someone from that team in order to get an invitation. ✉️
Slack,0,0,@hjbme The DM to yourself works very much as a notebook 📝; whereas Slackbot is a personal assistant that helps you do things in Slack. 🤖
Slack,0,0,@RemkoWeijnen We hear you! We'll share that thought with the team here. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@rubenschulz Does Cmd+1 do the trick?
Slack,0,0,@Gyunlim Afraid that's not possible, sorry! As a workaround, you can always add a channel topic with the channel message posting rules. 💡
Slack,0,0,@josephheenan Hopefully you should see improvements in the future, but we don't have an ETA to provide right now.
Slack,0,0,@thomasdeinhamer Sorry for the trouble, Thomas. 😞 It's a known issue that our team is working on fixing.
Slack,1,0,@lfopw So sorry! We're making improvements to the amount of resources being used, which should give you some battery back in the future. 🔋
Slack,0,0,@lancewalley Appreciate it! ✨
Slack,0,0,@lancewalley Gotcha. Mind taking screenshots of your steps, then sending the details to feedback@slack.com? It'll be easier to investigate!
Slack,0,0,@projectmyka Sorry for the trouble. It's not something we have right now, but we're listening to all feedback.
Slack,0,0,@RajarathnaVeena Thanks for the feedback! It's certainly something for us to consider. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@lancewalley Hmmm. 🤔 It should be possible from most devices. Where were you trying to upload your images from?
Slack,0,0,@celinasays Hmm, that's strange! Can you try selecting "Help" > "Clear cache and restart" and see whether that does the trick? 🙏
Slack,0,0,@noccer And our eternal gratitude, of course! 👑🐛⭐️
Slack,1,0,@noccer Yes! The prize is our super secret email address so you can tell us all about it! 😉👉 feedback@slack.com
Slack,1,0,@leafbelly Thank YOU! 🌻
Slack,0,0,@puosiveuw Sorry for all the hassle, 😓 though glad it's working again. If this issue returns, let us know and we'll dig into this with you.
Slack,0,0,@lachygroom Thanks for this solid suggestion! It's not on our roadmap, but we're happy to share this with the team. 😊
Slack,0,0,@puosiveuw Yes, we do. Let's troubleshoot this one! 👍 Could you double check your settings for us (Preferences > Notifications tab)?
Slack,1,0,@iPhonyMC A dark theme is something we're considering, but it isn't on our immediate roadmap. Thanks for suggesting it! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@ninamohanty  😍
Slack,1,0,@PavelLipcean There's a maximum limit of 10 integrations on the free plan. 🤖 Check out the details here: https://t.co/GF6g2102ev
Slack,1,0,@PavelLipcean Hi Pavel! Happy 4th of July to you too! Ah, that warning message indicates that your team is on the free plan.
Slack,0,0,@iansu Hey, thanks for the feedback, friend! We'll share it with our iOS team.
Slack,0,0,@ReneeSzostak Ah! We tend to use the Do Not Disturb feature to make sure that doesn't happen, but we'll give it some thought! Thanks! ✨
Slack,0,0,@celinasays Oh dear! If you try holding Shift+Esc, does that clear it by any chance?
Slack,1,0,@Omega_ Ah! Thank you for clarifying this for us. We will make note of this for the team. Thanks again, Alexander! 🐝 📝
Slack,0,0,@wagnerbeethoven We hear you, Wagner. We also appreciate your kindness and patience. Hopefully we can resolve this for you soon. Thanks! 🙌
Slack,0,0,@Omega_ 🤔 Currently, you can set a retention policy to "destroy" messages. We're thinking about Read Receipts, but nothing to report yet.🌟
Slack,0,0,@citrusui Sorry for the troubles here. Have you tried periodically quitting and re-launching the app? That will often help.
Slack,1,0,@OmarReiss Noted! Thank you for the feedback. 🙏
Slack,0,0,@wagnerbeethoven You can maybe try going to Preferences > Advanced, scroll down to “Debugging Options,” check “Disable local storage."
Slack,0,0,@wagnerbeethoven 😓  Our team is working on bettering this issue. We really appreciate your patience in the interim. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@areyoufried Ah! In that case, since you have admin status, this means the team is set to allow only Owners to approve those requests.
Slack,0,0,@StrayPixel We'll look into this. Thanks! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@StrayPixel Apologies, Elijah. We see that you're in! Sorry for the confusion.  🙏
Slack,0,0,@StrayPixel Hey, Elijah. Can you connect with a Team Owner or Admin, and have them turn off your 2FA from here: https://t.co/OQ556Ikstg
Slack,0,0,@hedgeb Anytime! 🙌
Slack,0,0,@StrayPixel Sorry to hear there's trouble signing in! After giving it a short period of time, are you able to login once again?
Slack,0,0,@hedgeb Merging could get confusing for channel history, but import and export options might help!  https://t.co/QZrfMTb7Mw
Slack,0,0,@pegasusepsilon ...https://t.co/WeWXcwsZIU so we can investigate right away? Thanks 2/2
Slack,0,0,@pegasusepsilon That is definitely not something that should be happening at all. Can you please let us know what you're seeing at... 1/2
Slack,0,0,@areyoufried We'd recommend getting in touch with one of your team's admins or owners, as they should be able to look into this for you.
Slack,7,1,@johnnyrodgersis We're so glad you're back! And we're so thrilled with your newest addition! 💖👶
Slack,0,0,@RemkoWeijnen Interesting! We don't have auto-threading, but our own team uses emoji like ✅ to sign off on completed items— could that work?
Slack,0,0,@philipamour Nope! As long as you stick to "Clear cache and restart" rather than "Reset app data" you should be good to go 👍
Slack,1,0,@OmarReiss We hear you! That's definitely a thoughtful idea. We'll give it some thought! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@philipamour Thanks! Have you tried clearing the cache from the Help menu in the MacOS menu bar yet? We've got our fingers crossed!
Slack,0,0,@ohcibi Sorry, not sure we follow! We've always allowed up to 5 single channel guests per regular member for paid teams.
Slack,1,0,@RLerallut We don't fool around when it comes to cheese. 🧀
Slack,1,0,@wizonesolutions Via feedback https://t.co/WeWXcwsZIU would be best so we can get the right folks on the case ASAP. Sorry for the trouble!
Slack,0,0,@philipamour That definitely doesn't seem like the expected behavior! Can we ask which version of the client you're on at the moment? 🙇
Slack,0,0,@jchiarav  Le hemos respondido al correo electrónico que nos envió. Si tiene alguna pregunta adicional, ¡no dude en contactarnos de nuevo :)
Slack,0,0,@galenking No problem :) You would indeed need to update the integration with new projects, yes!
Slack,0,0,@IrregularExpr Excellent 😊 Do keep us posted and sorry again for the trouble!
Slack,0,0,@IrregularExpr This is a known bug we're working on at present. Apologies for the trouble! Does a reload via Ctrl + R help for now?
Slack,0,0,@galenking You have to manually select them for now, sorry about that!
Slack,1,0,@Aly_Jwd That's no problem at all and thanks for the kind words :)
Slack,0,1,@Aly_Jwd We will of course share it with them and we appreciate your honest thoughts 🙏 Thank you!
Slack,0,0,@petemorrisios Thanks so much for doing so :)
Slack,0,0,@Aly_Jwd And perhaps we will be able to consider this further. We will let them know you'd like to see this 2/2
Slack,0,0,@Aly_Jwd We are very grateful for your feedback and always carefully consider this. We can certainly share your thoughts with the team 1/2
Slack,0,0,@petemorrisios This is a known bug then we're afraid. You should see improvements in the next version so we hope you can bear with us 🙏😊
Slack,0,0,@wizonesolutions Sure! Could you please contact /feedback so we can provide some troubleshooting steps? We just need more room, apologies!
Slack,0,0,@Aly_Jwd Sorry about that, we changed the UI a while ago. Could you drop a link to the new channel in general instead so people can join up?
Slack,0,0,@petemorrisios By any chance do you end up manually cancelling that download as a result of it not working, or does it crash regardless?
Slack,0,0,@ceo_or_bust Very strange, thanks for sharing! Could you please reach out to feedback@slack.com so we can dig further for you? Thanks!
Slack,0,0,@moskoben Thanks for reporting, we'll look into it!
Slack,0,0,@lichteleucht It's only possible to deactivate accounts unless you're the Primary Owner where you can delete the whole team and accounts.

Slack,0,0,@CraftByte No plans for this right now!
Slack,0,0,@gitmerge Thanks again for letting us know your thoughts on this, much appreciated! Will pass onto the team on your behalf 📝
Slack,0,0,@Aly_Jwd What happens when you type the username into the search box and try to invite them to that channel? 🤔
Slack,1,0,@antoniotroina This is a known issue, so sorry! We do have some tips that might help if you'd like to send this to feedback@slack.com 👍

Slack,0,0,@CheckedAU If no activity is detected on desktop after 30 mins, Slack will go offline and will start pushing notifications to your mobile. 📱
Slack,0,0,@stantonk Has it stopped working recently? Are you receiving push notifications for mentions and keywords?
Slack,0,0,@moskoben 🤔 Interesting! Is it a custom emoji in between the two pray emojis?
Slack,0,0,@vasuvasu If on a Mac, it's intentional! The microphone is behind one speaker, so sound comes from the other so there's no feedback loops. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@DavidBoike  🙌
Slack,1,0,@leafbelly So sorry about that, private channels can only be archived. https://t.co/KVmAxWYKdF
Slack,0,0,@DavidBoike Well Heck. Could you please write in with screenshots in that case? feedback@slack.com
Slack,0,0,@sikachu You can, however you would also have to turn off All Unreads as well.
Slack,0,0,@TGTutoring Thanks for letting us know! We'll pass this on.
Slack,0,0,@DavidBoike So sorry! Could you please try resetting your local cache on iOS? Swipe left, Settings > Advanced > Reset Local Cache
Slack,0,0,@PhABCD So sorry, but this is not something that's on our roadmap. Thanks for letting us know you'd still like to see it, however.
Slack,2,0,@myetherwallet So sorry! Our team is looking into this. Please write in with details: feedback@slack.com
Slack,0,0,@DomLuxfordly So sorry about this! What sort of problems? Feel free to write in: feedback@slack.com 🙌

Slack,0,0,@PavelLipcean Ah, we get it! Maybe have a look here? https://t.co/Py2QSMrw83
Slack,0,0,@lexandermygind 👍
Slack,1,0,@worldcodename_G We have audio and video calling capability! https://t.co/gffXaPTWde
Slack,0,0,@iankent Hm. Could you write in so we can have a look? feedback@slack.com 🙌
Slack,1,0,@Esquiring Turning off any extensions you have running would have been our next advice! If that doesn't reveal anything let us know!
Slack,0,0,@johnalxndr The team is considering the best way forward for this, and thanks for letting us know you'd like to see it.
Slack,0,0,@iankent Thanks for the kind words! Could you tell us where you see the URL identifier? feedback@slack.com
Slack,0,0,@UltraSub Thanks for the feedback. Nothing as such, but well make a note of it!
Slack,0,0,@Esquiring  Oh dear. Does a refresh solve things? Could you tell us if you see this in a browser or a desktop app?
Slack,0,0,@jacobbednarz There should not be! If you are having issues, could you write in? feedback@slack.com
Slack,0,0,@kelleyshine Oh no! Could you try quitting Slack, unpinning it, then launching and pinning again?
Slack,1,0,@mathieudelvaux Oh dear, sorry about that! Could you write in so we can investigate? feedback@slack.com
Slack,0,0,@mangicrypto Would you please email details about this to feedback@slack.com?
Slack,0,0,@riking27 Sorry for the trouble! Please write to feedback@slack.com and we'll help with this.
Slack,0,0,@robertedwards There isn't, sorry. Though you can use "3 July 2017" when setting a reminder.
Slack,0,0,@AsheshAmbasta No, we're not aware of anything like that. Would you please write to feedback@slack.com so we can get more information?
Slack,0,0,@Skyekm Very sorry about the trouble. We had a brief issue that should be fixed now.
Slack,0,0,@Idyilere That site isn't ours so we wouldn't be able to help with it, sorry.
Slack,0,0,@bkastl Sorry, we don't have a timeline we can share. We're working on it though!
Slack,0,0,@Idyilere Where exactly are you seeing that error? In the Slack app?
Slack,1,0,@RenoInMO We'll let the team know that's an option you'd like to see! Thanks for the suggestion.
Slack,0,0,@mdonatas Our Windows desktop app does have a notifications badge on the taskbar icon. What else would you like to see?
Slack,0,0,@bennimack Those can be edited here: https://t.co/jNDAh7Aml5
Slack,0,0,@ka_piva In that case please send screenshots over to feedback@slack.com with the team's details. We'll look into this.
Slack,0,0,@criscmaia Sorry about that, it's not available through the API. Time zones are set on an individual user basis.
Slack,1,0,@beeman_nl We'll do our best, and thank you for the feedback!
Slack,0,0,@bennimack Not sure what you're looking to do exactly. Mine elaborating? You want to edit your permitted signup email domains?
Slack,0,0,@chantilli We're seeing a bit of a hiccup with posts right now. We're working on it, sorry for the disruption for now. 😓
Slack,6,0,@Fillerin0 Not at the moment, but we'll make a note of it as something to think about! 💭
Slack,1,0,@gytdau Huh. So it doesn't! We'll see about getting that looked into. 🤓
Slack,0,0,@ka_piva Oh! You're saying you have two different pictures? Is it possible you're signing into a different team on mobile vs desktop?
Slack,0,0,@JamesMunnelly It's that way right now for security's sake: each team admin configures their own preferred security settings. 🔐
Slack,0,0,@visa_interview Sadly, no. But you can set that channel as a default one in your admin settings. Then, everyone is in as soon as they join.
Slack,0,0,@bluedonkey Interesting! Let us share that with the team. 💸
Slack,0,0,@robv23 👋 Thanks for the check-in! It's still on our radar.

Slack,0,0,@enshrined Hmmm, is this happening in the Slack app? Have you tried clearing the cache to see if that resolves the issue? Let us know!
Slack,0,0,@megmischler Oh dear! We're praying you won't be lonely for too long! 🙏
Slack,1,0,@ashleymarinep Possibly! We'll certainly let the team know it's a feature you'd love to see down the line. 🔮 Thanks!
Slack,0,0,@riddle 2/2..., we recommend manually uploading files using the [+] icon to avoid crashing behavior. Thanks for bearing with us on this one.
Slack,0,0,@riddle We're hoping to have this fixed as soon as possible, so sorry again for the wait. In the meantime...1/2
Slack,0,0,@pcamp96 Sounds like a possible bug with iOS notifications. Mind dropping us a line to feedback@slack.com so we can investigate further? 🕵️
Slack,0,0,@ka_piva It's not possible unfortunately, they're synced across platforms!
Slack,1,0,@TweetsOfSumit It's a custom response added by your team mates! You can add them here: https://t.co/ZzUBtgNUjL
Slack,0,0,@artismarti We still don't have an ETA on this, so sorry for the annoyance. Thanks for bearing with us 🙏
Slack,0,0,@add_action_dan can we take a look into this with you? Our email is feedback@slack.com

Slack,0,0,@whereismeersman 🦋🌸🌳🌼🌈
Slack,0,0,@lmrz 🙌
Slack,0,0,@visa_interview Alas, no. Slash commands can only be triggered by human messages directly from Slack! 🤖🎈
Slack,0,0,@ixisit We’ll pass the feedback along to our team. 🌸
Slack,0,0,@dalman If you could please drop us a line at feedback@slack.com we'll have one of the specialists take a look for you! 🙏
Slack,0,0,@lmrz @anthonysterling Hmm, that sounds a bit odd — mind writing to feedback@slack.com so we can dig into this for you?
Slack,0,0,@codeOfRobin @meghafon Eep! Is this happening on the latest version (v2.6.2)? Can you see if Help > Clear Cache and Restart helps please?
Slack,0,0,@meghafon Oh dear! What version does this happen on for you? Also, do you find Help > Clear Cache and Restart makes a difference?
Slack,0,0,@TimDierckxsens Thank you, we'll have one of our specialists investigate!
Slack,0,0,@BaggySEO Ah, we see what you mean! Hmm, if you don't mind dropping a line to feedback@slack.com, we can take a closer look at it. 🙏

Slack,0,0,@ixisit We hear you, and we'll look into how we can improve it. If you're feeling handy, you could cook something up using our API!
Slack,1,0,@psilfver We don't support file uploads in Threads yet, but we're working on it!
Slack,0,0,@ixisit The quickest way is to ask your team to delete their own unused files at: https://t.co/7NUNu6dTjS.

Slack,1,0,@lz650sss We'll need to have a closer look at what's going wrong. Do you mind writing in to us at feedback@slack.com? 🙏
Slack,0,0,@BaggySEO Timezones are set at account-level and can be changed at: https://t.co/hODkgz6M8K. Is there something amiss in your team's stats?
Slack,0,0,@anthonysterling That's interesting! 🤔 We'll share that thought with the team here. 📞
Slack,0,0,@robertsammons We're long overdue on this front! It's on our list, hang in there. 😊
Slack,0,0,@DKatri Nothing unusual from our side right now! Thanks for reporting though. Can we take a deeper look? Our email is feedback@slack.com
Slack,1,0,@MelWas Thanks very much, Mel 🙇
Slack,0,0,@BabyAzerty Thanks very much!
Slack,0,0,@dalman Oh no! Sorry about that. Which mobile app are you using?
Slack,0,0,@BabyAzerty Sorry about that! Do you mind dropping us a line to feedback@slack.com about this?
Slack,1,0,@MelWas Oh dear! Sorry about that. Do you mind writing in? We'll take a look: https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,1,0,@MelWas If you go into a direct message, you'll see a star you can click under the team member's name at the top.
Slack,0,0,@MelWas We keep only recent conversations visible to prevent clutter. You can star a conversation to have it shown permanently, though!
Slack,1,1,@tobiasgies We often recommend giving bots their own channel, which can be left or muted etc.
Slack,0,0,@looptrader We're looking into the situation as we speak. Do drop us a line if your team is seeing issues: https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,0,0,@cookstaar Because people might have shared on the understanding of a degree of privacy.
Slack,1,0,@lurexus Oh crikey — that's a good point. Meantime, you could give them nice distinct themes? (Preferences > Sidebar theme)
Slack,4,0,@mattparkins @alex_persian Since you put it like that, Matt, how could we have gone with anything else? (Btw, your name is upside down)
Slack,0,0,@lz650sss Sorry about that! Which app or browser are you using?
Slack,0,0,@rrosen84 Sorry about that! Would you mind sending us details so we can try to reproduce this? https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,2,0,@TSigberg We can pass along to the team that you'd like to see this changed 🙌
Slack,0,0,@TSigberg Private channels evolved from early group conversations, which it didn't make sense to delete. Not the best reason, sorry…
Slack,1,0,@stevenlangbroek Neat idea! Thanks for sharing 📌
Slack,1,0,@taka_dhu No trouble at all — thank you! ❣️

Slack,0,0,@bugfroggy Hmm, things look peachy from our end. 🤔 If you're still seeing this error, please drop us a note: https://t.co/WeWXcwsZIU 🔍
Slack,0,0,@acblet Oh no! 😓 Bring them all up with '/remind list' —  maybe there's some you can delete? 📝☕️
Slack,0,0,@PavelLipcean There should be place for it when a team members edit their profile. 🤔 Are you seeing something else?
Slack,1,0,@MussarMusic 👋 Please drop us a note, we'll take a look: https://t.co/WeWXcwsZIU 💌
Slack,0,0,@hebinotoshi No option currently, sorry. 😔 But more customizable options for reminders is on our radar. 📝 Thanks for sharing! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@bscht No keyboard shortcuts?! 😱 Could you please write in so we can take a closer look? https://t.co/WeWXcwsZIU
Slack,0,0,@oliverbenns Oof. Sorry, Oliver. 😓 We're working on reducing Slack's footprint. Please bear with us. 🚧
Slack,0,0,@jeffweisbein Yikes! Apologies, Jeff! Please drop us a note so we can get you back online: feedback@slack.com ⚡️
Slack,0,0,@taka_dhu Oh boy, that's strange! Does your time zone look correct? 👉 Click your team name, then Preferences > Language & Region.
Slack,0,0,@Dan17894652 Hmm, the folks in the Melbourne office tell us it could also mean 'smart casual trousers'. Interesting! 🤔💭👖
Slack,0,0,@mons00n It can take up to 24 hours to see the change reflected on the statistics page. Please hang tight! 🏄
Slack,0,0,@BrianKFrancis Oh, lovely! 🙌 Let us know if there's anything else we can give you a hand with. 🎈
Slack,0,0,@jeffweisbein 😬Uh-oh, we're sorry for the trouble. Are you using Slack in a browser or a desktop app? Can you connect in Chrome Incognito?
Slack,2,0,@SQLRockstar Hi there, we're sorry this isn't your preference. You're not alone with this request, and we'll note the continued interest ✍😄
Slack,15,1,@alex_persian We knew we had to limit reactions to avoid clutter and encourage creativity, and 23 seemed like a nice prime number.¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Slack,0,0,@_RGT12_ Very kind of you to say so! 🐝
Slack,0,0,@BrianKFrancis Oh no! We'd like to look into this further - can you drop us a line at feedback@slack.com? 📝👀

Slack,0,0,@apiousman We've no ETA to share just yet, but we're working on it 🙌
Slack,0,0,@OhNoItsFusl But we've shared your feedback with the team — sorry again for the annoyance 🙌
Slack,0,0,@OhNoItsFusl We're really sorry for the frustration. We're now showing some info sooner rather than waiting longer to show all of it.
Slack,1,0,@nabinno Sorry about that! Do you mind dropping us a line about this? https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,1,0,@noboundsdigital More info: https://t.co/ZpsIvgDWDo
Slack,1,0,@noboundsdigital Btw, you can choose what channels are imported at the import stage.
Slack,0,0,@petebocken Sorry about that! We'll let the team know this is something you'd like. Thanks 🙌
Slack,2,0,@bikehugger @mathowie You should see what he can do on a penny-farthing…
Slack,0,0,@KhayaMaloney Sorry for the frustration! Heavy in what way?

Slack,0,0,@86era Sorry about that! Do you mind writing in so we can explore this in more detail? https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,0,0,@melomap We retired the web archive view — sorry for any confusion. Archives should be viewable in-app, though!
Slack,0,0,@robyn_ravenclaw You should be able to share a link to a GIF and have it display in channel — does that help?
Slack,0,0,@char_fish We'd like to investigate this further. Would you mind writing us at feedback@slack.com? Thanks!
Slack,1,0,@noboundsdigital We hear you, Ben. We're looking to improve this process. If you hit any walls, email us at feedback@slack.com.
Slack,0,0,@w00tyLab  We don't have this option just yet! Sorry about that. We are working to make improvements in this area! 🙏

Slack,5,0,@darcylou  Oh dear! We are investigating this bug as we speak. Thank you for your patience and sorry for the scare. 👻
Slack,1,0,@octal Ah! We see what you mean. We’ll pass the idea along! ⭐
Slack,3,0,@OtyMartin 😎 We hear you, Martin! Your feedback has been duly noted. 📝
Slack,0,0,@HeatherSmithAU Yup! For security reasons, you will have to sign into all teams.
Slack,0,0,@andymadge If any were directed to Private Channels, you will have to re-create them. 😬
Slack,0,0,@andymadge As an Admin/Owner, you should be able to re-enable any integrations pointing to Public Channels here: https://t.co/ZpLTzsB134
Slack,1,0,@TheTannerRyan @kilodelta You sure can! Just visit our Slack Shop: https://t.co/vhPGzZ7F7D 🙌
Slack,0,0,@86era 🤔 Hmm. Does it work for you in other apps? Can you also try powering down and then restarting. Thanks!
Slack,1,0,@octal Sure thing! Tell us more about what you mean when you say 'locking down a channel,' and we'll see if there's anything to suggest. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@NotBabafemi We hear you, Femi. We'll relay this feedback to the team for you. Thanks for sharing! 🙌

Slack,1,0,@duellsy Many, many little Slack helpers! 👩🏻‍💻👨🏻‍💻👩🏾‍💻👨🏿‍💻👩‍💻👨‍💻
Slack,1,0,@benhaynes That's certainly an idea! We aren't currently planning on this, but it's food for thought. Thanks!
Slack,1,0,@idftech Hey thanks! 😘
Slack,0,0,@tennyson1842 Oh no! Can we ask which browser you are using? If you try an incognito or private browser, does that work?
Slack,0,0,@tennyson1842 Can you try this help test, and send us the results when it's finished? https://t.co/X1Uo3T8GP5
Slack,0,0,@tennyson1842 Oh dear! We're not seeing troubles on our side: are you getting an error message you could share with us?
Slack,0,0,@lelandf Hmmm, do you have more than 1 team signed in? Could there be an unread DM or mention in a secondary team perchance?
Slack,0,0,@duncanjeremy Sadly, that is an ongoing issue the team is working on. So sorry for the inconvenience! 🙌
Slack,0,0,@caolantweets Sorry for the bad news there 😞  We'll share your feedback with our team to give more thought to.
Slack,0,0,@ultimape Oh dear, that looks like a reminder set by one of the users on your team. Please contact your team admin and let them know!
Slack,0,0,@jedahan You can always send through a note to our team via https://t.co/WeWXcwsZIU when you have a chance, and our team will dig in! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@mittense Ooh we see what you mean. We've heard some folks have tried remapping their Esc key— is that something you've tried at all?
Slack,1,0,@Kraft @Folletto Yup! Electron is the base we use for the Windows, Mac, and Linux client ✨
Slack,1,0,@jamiefeedback We see what you mean and we'll be happy to pass this on. 💖
Slack,0,0,@caolantweets We recently retired the message archives. We can seamlessly load links now directly in the app.
Slack,0,0,@mittense Yes indeed! You can use `Shift+esc` to mark all channels in a team as read.
Slack,1,0,@icastanheda It is! Tap the message you'd like to reply to, and type a reply. 📱
Slack,0,0,@jedahan Where are you seeing a mandatory field like that? Could you send a screenshot?
Slack,0,0,@mikejimlarry No, that's not possible, sorry.
Slack,0,0,@sarahhalle Campaign? Are we running for election? No one told us! We should probably go by suits.
Slack,0,0,@erinlauraoneil 🤔 Please write to feedback@slack.com with the team details so we can take a closer look into this.
Slack,0,0,@OhNoItsFusl We're very sorry. We're working to speed thing up so all information in a channel loads more quickly.
Slack,0,0,@calebsboyd Thanks!
Slack,1,0,@crouhana We're afraid it's not possible to do so at this time; sorry for any inconvenience this causes!
Slack,0,0,@TylerJBunnell ...apologies! Our team is aware of it and working on this issue 🙏 2/2
Slack,0,0,@TylerJBunnell Ah, gotcha. We do have a known issue where calls use discrete, and the app doesn't switch after the call ends. Our... 1/2
Slack,0,0,@TylerJBunnell Sorry about this, Tyler! Is this after placing a call in Slack by chance?
Slack,0,0,@calebsboyd Could you send your team details and some specific example URLs to feedback@slack.com? We'll take a closer look into this.
Slack,0,0,@thats_so_neil Oh no! What a jumbled up way to start your weekend. Can you try refreshing (Cmd + R) to see if that helps?
Slack,0,0,@icywolfy We're terribly sorry for the frustrating experience. Does Ctrl + R or Cmd + R help at all?
Slack,2,0,@SeanJA 👋 With a quick refresh, this should be fixed! And thank goodness, it was driving our writers up a wall.
Slack,0,0,@mybeachisbetter Ah! Please drop us a note so we can see what might be possible. feedback@slack.com 🙌
Slack,1,0,@pmenonb  😔  You're running into a bug that our team is working to tackle. Deleting and then reinstalling the app should fix this for you.
Slack,1,0,@Folletto Noted. Please know we'll share this with the team over here. 👉
Slack,1,0,@houstongraham No timeline to give you yet. Perhaps we do need to reorganize our priorities 😅 . Thanks for your patience!
Slack,0,0,@ProfessorTom There isn't a way to mute a channel for a specified time. That is a very good idea though! We'll make note it for you. 📝
Slack,0,0,@hatsharpener Sorry about that! 😅 Threads within a public channel are visible to anyone on the team if they click into them.
Slack,1,0,@kenliecer ¡Gracias Kenneth! Quizás algún día. 💖
Slack,0,0,@Indie_Intern That is not ideal. 😅 Please drop a note to feedback@slack.com and we'll help you out.
Slack,0,0,@ceo_or_bust It is? Can you share a screenshot of what that looks like? We're at feedback@slack.com if you prefer.
Slack,0,0,@realdarthdoesmc The bulk delete feature no longer exists, following the removal of the message archives pages. Sorry about that. ☹️
Slack,0,0,@calebsboyd  🤔 Is it unfurling in your team despite being blacklisted, or would you like it to not unfurl for everyone's teams?
Slack,0,0,@jonathansywulak Thanks for letting us know! We'll let our Platform team know this would be a major time-saver for you. 🚀
Slack,0,0,@allhailqueenbie 👍🏿👍🏾👍🏽👍🏼👍🏻✨
Slack,0,0,@paniolo08 No, this is new to us. Could you please go to https://t.co/5gmpOHU2Rn and send the results to Support? We'll investigate!
Slack,0,0,@tyler_warnecke There’s no upper limit, but you may not have the most ideal experience with several thousand members.
Slack,0,1,@iamVP7 We don't have an all-at-once option, but we'd be happy to email you a list of all your teams: https://t.co/oUb433Gxi1 💌
Slack,0,0,@tyler_warnecke It's not possible to have just anyone join a team, but there are a few options available: https://t.co/1ypdIh3WFV.
Slack,0,0,@_siddheshM We hear you — we're working hard to get thing back to normal.
Slack,1,0,@melboyce Well spotted! Thanks, we'll let our documentation crew know. 🌟
Slack,0,0,@j0hnluke Interesting, we'll share it with the team! We don't have that, but maybe something in our App Directory?: https://t.co/tNULINngLT
Slack,1,0,@lukebrewster Thanks for the kind words, Luke! There are no firm plans for this at the moment, but this is a great suggestion.
Slack,0,0,@SirDugs Custom slash commands can be configured to send GET requests, but App commands cannot. Sorry!
Slack,1,0,@jamesleebennett It’s not currently on the roadmap, but we’ll consider it for the future. Thanks for the suggestion! 🎈
Slack,0,0,@maslowbeer Alas, no — we understand this is frustrating for you. It’s not currently on the roadmap, but we’ll consider it for the future.
Slack,0,0,@SeanJA Very strange! We'll let the team know and investigate — thanks for letting us know!
Slack,1,0,@derfleck Alas, no, it's only possible to activate it for a day at the moment — we are exploring the options, however.
Slack,0,0,@ntcoding Thank you for these thoughts — we'll pass them to the team, and look into how it can be improved!
Slack,0,0,@SeanJA Just to confirm, could you let us know where you're seeing this? Is it a timestamp for a message posted in a channel?
Slack,13,0,@Hacker0x01 🍔🍔🍔
Slack,0,0,@SirDugs Ah, we get you now! App icons need to be squares, so that seems to be the problem with your image.
Slack,0,0,@ntcoding We're sorry it's not working for you at the moment, but we're taking all feedback on board. What seems to be the problem?
Slack,0,0,@SirDugs Strange! What exactly are you seeing when you try to upload it, and what app and version are you using?
Slack,0,0,@SeanJA Oops, thanks for flagging this to us Sean! 🙈
Slack,1,0,@hersh_amin Ah, we hear you. It’s not currently on the roadmap, but we’ll consider this for the future.
Slack,0,0,@j0hnluke Hmm, do you mean inspirational loading messages, or just daily inspirational messages for your team?
Slack,0,0,@aleximj Hmm, you should be able to! What seems to be happening for you? 🤔
Slack,1,0,@hersh_amin Is there anything in particular that is causing problems?
Slack,1,0,@DomStich That's it! A gentle tap. 😄
Slack,1,0,@DomStich You can start a thread following these steps: tap on the message, then tap on Start a thread and press return. 🙌
Slack,1,0,@dblencowe Oh, sorry for the trouble! Do you mind writing us a report at https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X? 🙏

Slack,0,0,@sfhosley We'll certainly relay that feedback to the team for you :)
Slack,0,0,@thomasdegry Thanks so much - we will take a look into it more closely for you now.
Slack,0,0,@thomasdegry Could you please try this test and forward the results to /feedback: https://t.co/fHDQCFxYhG we will dig further! Thanks 2/2
Slack,0,0,@thomasdegry It shouldn't cause any problems that you're connecting from Europe. 1/2
Slack,0,0,@thomasdegry We've not had other reports of this thus far. Are others on your network experiencing the same issue?
Slack,0,0,@Js41637 We pull this from the page's meta data. Might be good feedback for that site? 📜

Slack,0,0,@anupriyako If so, would you mind dropping us a line? https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,0,0,@anupriyako Sorry about that! Do you still see this if you refresh your team with Ctrl/Cmd R?
Slack,0,1,@bscht Afraid this bug is still ongoing 😏 So sorry about that, we hope to have it resolved very soon. Thanks for bearing with us 🤗
Slack,0,0,@seanjreilly Sorry about that! This is a known issue — but thanks for the nudge 🙌
Slack,0,0,@danjessen Hmm, can you please restart the app by pressing Cmd + Q and then reopen Slack. Let me know if that brings them back for you! 🤞
Slack,0,0,@martinbeentjes 2/2...on your team use them. We'll share your message as a feature request with the team in charge of custom statuses. ✍️
Slack,0,0,@martinbeentjes We did consider animated emojis for status updates but we decided that it could be very distracting if lots of users...1/2

Slack,0,0,@benwdwd Afraid we don't support consolidated logins across teams for security & administrative reasons. Sorry for the frustration!
Slack,1,0,@aaronorosen We hear you! No ETA, but we're exploring both image/file threads. We'll let the team know you're keen!
Slack,0,0,@jay_peg Hmm, 🤔 that's quite strange, sorry! Would you mind writing in? We'd love to dig into this further with you. https://t.co/KsR6mZY2hf
Slack,0,0,@JohnZimmerman Lucky we didn't write it down in pen. 😅 Note amended! 📝
Slack,0,0,@chrislorensson ✨🏄🎈
Slack,2,0,@keranm @girlie_mac Oh, yay! We're glad you two met up after all! 🍿
Slack,0,0,@sfhosley (You can check that by swiping left in Slack > Settings > About.)
Slack,0,0,@sfhosley We received a few similar reports a while back, but we believe this issue to be fixed. Which version of Slack for iOS are you on?
Slack,0,0,@sfhosley Got it. Are you using the Slack desktop app, or web browser? Mac or Windows? If you're accessing Slack via browser, which one?
Slack,0,0,@mattbettinson 😂 😇
Slack,0,0,@sfhosley Oh, that's unusual. There should actually be a progress bar along the top of the channel. Do you see a green bar along the top?
Slack,0,0,@B_Meson Thanks so much! 🙇🏻
Slack,0,0,@B_Meson Okay! Could you please update to our latest version, 2.6.3, from https://t.co/GCw7YxxgIh? We have a feeling this will fix things!
Slack,4,0,@dubstrike You are ever-so-welcome.
Slack,0,0,@brenolf_ Sorry, we don't have any updates on this particular feature. It's not currently prioritized on our roadmap, we're afraid. 🤕
Slack,2,1,@TheClaudacity We hear carrier pigeons were all the rage. 🐦
Slack,0,0,@JohnZimmerman Noted! We agree, that would be a helpful addition. 📝
Slack,0,0,@jay_peg 😓 Ah, Mac or Windows? Slack *should* open links in your computer's default browser. You changed this at the system level, correct?
Slack,0,0,@B_Meson Yikes. Are you on the Mac or Windows app? Does the font size change permanently, or is it a temporary thing?
Slack,0,0,@sfhosley Ow, sorry about that! You're noticing that it's taking a while to load your status when you change it, yes?
Slack,0,0,@cdiersing Oh! Like, as in, emoji reaction? You can add custom emoji from https://t.co/VwJXlFZv8s, then you can react with that emoji. 😉
Slack,1,0,@GetSlingshot Nice idea! For now, you can paste the hex codes into your internal DM, then click the button to apply them quickly. 🎨
Slack,0,0,@hksperl Hmmmm! Could any of these be the app you're looking for? https://t.co/EUNbOKJYQj 😅
Slack,0,0,@G33kyGills Oh no! Are you missing notifications on your watch? Or is the entire interface not working anymore?
Slack,0,0,@cinnabar3 Oh, afraid not. If it's being used in a specific unhelpful manner, you might try talking to your team and your admins about it!
Slack,3,0,@anildash 😅👋✨
Slack,0,0,@willcharczuk Oh, uploaded .webm files should auto-expand like you'd expect, but properly unfurling .webm links are also on our list! 🎉
Slack,0,0,@gauravphoenix Well, drat. In that case, would you be able to drop feedback@slack.com a line so we can dig deeper into what's going wrong? 💌
Slack,0,0,@B_Meson Hrmm, odd. Is that happening in both a browser and one of our desktop apps? Does it change size while you have the channel open? 🤔
Slack,0,0,@ryanvarick Right! Makes sense to us. ✨📣
Slack,0,0,@rmgenson Oh, no, sorry to say that's a known issue with the app, Rachael. It's on our radar, though, and we're hoping to fix it up soon! 🐛
Slack,0,0,@vyscond We’re exploring this idea, so stay tuned! 🎶
Slack,0,0,@billhelm  Sorry for the trouble! It’s not currently on the roadmap, but we’ll consider it for the future. Thanks for the suggestion! 🙏
Slack,1,0,@schultetonya  You’re making us blush! 😍
Slack,2,0,@adriana_howell  Cheers! 🍹🙌
Slack,0,0,@vykromond We've made some changes to how archives are launched, but the links should work in your browser from IRC.
Slack,0,0,@evolvability A team admin can turn on the "shuffle" feature for Giphy. That way you can decline to post gifs you don't like.
Slack,0,0,@kirabug That's no good! Please get in touch at feedback@slack.com and our iOS team will take a look.
Slack,0,0,@gauravphoenix 🤔 Can you try refreshing the app and see if you get the same result?
Slack,1,0,@agisilaosts We're sorry for the trouble. Better offline, low-bandwidth, and intermittent connection support are all planned.
Slack,0,0,@ryanvarick Sorry, not sure we understand. You want different preferences for DM notifications than you have for channels?
Slack,0,0,@topikito  Also, you can disable rich media in Preferences > Messages & Media > Inline Messages & Links.
Slack,0,0,@topikito We have another tip to share! Try typing /collapse to minimize animated gifs and rich media in channels. 👍
Slack,0,0,@ryanvarick Certainly! In the DM, click the Settings cog button > Notification preferences > All new messages. 👍
Slack,2,0,@DP_CyberCrime No immediate plans to change this, but thank you for the suggestion. We'll share it with the team. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@DP_CyberCrime That is the minimum length, but we recommend following this handy guide for creating safe passwords: https://t.co/xrPTvjaSkY
Slack,0,0,@vasuchawla Ah, afraid it's not possible right now, but it's a great suggestion. We'll share it with the team!
Slack,0,0,@goldiesquats Oooh. We don't have it yet, but the API is there if you're interested in building it! https://t.co/7ricUn6DcJ
Slack,1,0,@ALR42 That's an idea! 💡Thanks for sharing this with us! 👍
Slack,0,0,@erinlauraoneil 🤔 Are you trying to delete a private channel perhaps? At this time, it's only possible to archive private channels.
Slack,0,0,@sarahspoon It shouldn't, sorry. Can you go to iOS Settings > Slack > enable Reset Cache on Next Launch > let us know if a re-launch helps?
Slack,0,0,@notthatnathan Super weird. Glad to hear it's fixed, but do let us know if it happens again. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Slack,1,0,@benwiley4000 Fair! We'll pass your feedback along to the team.
Slack,1,0,@patleeman Ah gotcha! Yep, it's custom alright!
Slack,0,0,@ChrisCharabaruk We see what you mean there! Thanks for the suggestion too. We'll pass this along. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@bvhme We feel it’s important that work teams have a channel where everyone can be reached! If you like, you can mute the channel! 💡
Slack,1,0,@john_fisherman That's really good feedback! We'll look into making that better. Thanks for sharing!
Slack,0,0,@topikito 😕 We're working on improvements in this area. For now, restarting Slack may help!
Slack,0,0,@sarahspoon 😭 Which version of Slack you're using? We'll look into this.
Slack,4,0,@BenRCongdon Could be indeed 🤔. We'll pass your thoughts along!
Slack,0,0,@mattvogt Hmm… are you on Windows perhaps? There's a bug we're looking into around shift-esc at the moment.
Slack,1,0,@EricMarkDo 🌈✨
Slack,0,0,@elbutler Hmm… definitely sounds like a bug. Would you mind dropping a line to feedback@slack.com with some details?
Slack,0,0,@gmcconnaughey 💡 That's an idea! We'll give this some thought. 😃
Slack,0,0,@benwiley4000 We appreciate the feedback! If it helps at all, it also puts in a modifier limiting the search to your current channel.
Slack,1,0,@kplanz Haven't planned on it, no, but we're keeping our options open for the future. Thanks for letting us know how it's running for you! 🙇
Slack,0,0,@thenameisnat0 Ah! Yes, we're afraid that isn't going to work. Sorry about this! You'll need to contact a team Owner or Admin to join. 🎈
Slack,0,0,@AsherDeVuyst You're too kind! (We hope we're not failing too often, though!) 🌈🌲
Slack,1,0,@rafaelderolez Ah yes, that would be one of the quirks of Hangouts emoji! We're sorry that we can't make the labels match this set better.
Slack,1,0,@GroundControl They're coming! We're hoping to add the iOS 10 batch soon. Sorry about the delay! 🐙✨
Slack,0,0,@JoshAllegro Still every 5 minutes! (Is that not what you're experiencing, though? Let us know if you're having trouble!) 🍦
Slack,0,0,@Eva_CdA Thanks! We have a soft spot in our hearts for that old @playglitch forest. 🐖🌈🌲💖
Slack,0,0,@ikB3N No bribes required, just a bit of API finagling! Our blog has some basic instructions to get you started: https://t.co/l4y7jxI435
Slack,0,0,@PhillippOh 🙌
Slack,0,0,@username081 Thanks for writing in — one of our specialists is taking a look and will be in touch via email asap.
Slack,0,0,@PhillippOh Ooh, that's not ideal! If you drop us a line to feedback@slack.com we can take a closer look for you! 🙏
Slack,1,0,@laurahannawhite Alas, after the Battle of Dustball Gulch, we’re no longer allowed to have sticks at work, dusty or otherwise.
Slack,0,0,@username081 Hmm, if you drop us a line to feedback@slack.com we'll take a closer look at the situation!
Slack,0,0,@username081 From the screenshot it looks as though that's a reminder sent by someone else on the team, so your Team Owners can take action.
Slack,0,0,@FactDeJour Phew, glad to hear it! On the latest version (v2.6.3) you should also be able to use the right-click option. ✨
Slack,0,0,@NimaiMalle Ah, that's a good point. We'll definitely think about it! 🌸
Slack,0,0,@FactDeJour Oh no! What exactly are you seeing — is this using the right click menu or cmd/ctrl + v?
Slack,1,0,@adrianorbs Thanks for the suggestion — much appreciated 🙌
Slack,1,0,@JeffGlueck Sorry for the trouble! Would you mind sending us details of the problems you're seeing? https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,4,0,@HannahOmid @dens We know it's not the best experience right now, sorry! It's an Electron issue we're looking at. 🐛
Slack,0,0,@joewalshrocks Oof, not ideal! Thanks for letting us know about this — it's certainly something for us to consider.
Slack,0,0,@dtuite We hear you, and are exploring how reminders can be improved, so stay tuned! 📻
Slack,1,0,@fhendrie Gotcha. It’s not currently on the roadmap, but (for the Jensen gif) we’ll consider it for the future. ✨
Slack,0,0,@astroaware More info! https://t.co/npkXTJjKGy
Slack,0,0,@astroaware You can pin Posts to channels, and share them so they're editable by all 📝👩‍👩‍👧‍👧📌
Slack,0,0,@fhendrie Groups as in kinda sorta like folders, do you mean?
Slack,1,0,@ndxcc Cripes — sorry about that! Could you drop us a line so we can look into things? https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,0,0,@joewalshrocks Oh dear — it isn't — sorry about that! We'll note for the team that there are visual differentiation issues here.
Slack,0,0,@tdmalone But we certainly take the feedback on board. Sorry for the frustration 🙌
Slack,1,1,@tdmalone Sorry for the delay! No, it wasn't something we announced. We reason most people will want to do things in Slack…
Slack,0,0,@timjreynolds Sorry about that! Does refreshing your team with Ctrl/Cmd R help? Please drop us a line if not: https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,0,0,@joewalshrocks Hello! No, alas! But an Admin can change the team icon, if that's the icon you mean: https://t.co/AVAi3UnNT9
Slack,1,0,@Brammm You can't, but it's an interesting idea — thanks! 🤔🙇‍♀️
Slack,0,0,@godling_zlm Not ideal, but you could temporarily zoom with Ctrl/Cmd = 🤔 (And you can return to default zoom with Ctrl/Cmd 0)
Slack,0,0,@Gyunlim Oh sorry — misunderstood! There isn't — sorry about that 🙌
Slack,0,0,@evilneuro That's so good to hear … on balance 😅🙌😱
Slack,0,0,@roccetry This isn't on our immediate roadmap, sorry — but we'll certainly note your feedback for the team 🙌
Slack,0,0,@Gyunlim Might just be a case of talking to a Team Owner or Admin to get this created, depending on team settings 👍
Slack,1,2,@vineetkaul Oh! On desktop, if you go to Preferences > Messages & Media > and untick the 'Convert Emoticons' option, does that help things?
Slack,2,0,@z_anderle Ah, so sorry, Žan. We're afraid that's the case for now. We know there's a lot to improve when it comes to managing many teams. 😔
Slack,0,0,@patleeman Thanks for the love! Is this the new input on mobile apps? We can't reveal too much, but we really appreciate the feedback!
Slack,0,0,@alpennec 💖
Slack,0,0,@I_am_Dan_Ellis So sorry, Dan. This is a known issue that we're hoping to fix as quickly as possible. Having to read it 10 times is no good.
Slack,1,0,@alpennec 👋 Mind asking this question through feedback@slack.com? We'll be able to explain better without the character limit!
Slack,0,0,@username081 We'd recommend speaking to your Team Owners or Admins, but we're always available at feedback@slack.com or /feedback.
Slack,0,0,@teppo You got it. Thanks for your patience! 🙇
Slack,1,1,@big_roof Any time! 🐻
Slack,0,0,@notthatnathan Ah, in Slack, click 'Slack' in the top toolbar, then 'About Slack'. Our latest v2.6.3 may fix this! https://t.co/RvUnYTicJJ
Slack,0,0,@Gyunlim Default channels for User Groups already exists! 🎉 More info on our Help Center: https://t.co/hcACFGYqyZ
Slack,1,0,@nickansel Gotcha! On desktop, does Preferences > Messages & Media > 'Show images and files...' > 'Even if they're larger than 2MB' help?
Slack,1,0,@JamesSLock Hmm, would you mind writing in so we can take a look? Sounds rather odd and we'd love to help! Here ➡️ https://t.co/bxxJ5hHg7X
Slack,0,0,@beckerben Ah, fair point. We'll feedback this to the team. Thanks for letting us know and apologies for the oversight! 🙏
Slack,0,0,@liubinskas Ugh, sorry you had to go to those lengths. Glad to hear you're back up and running though.
Slack,0,0,@jimmyzelinskie Ah, yikes! So sorry. Turns out you've run into a known bug we're currently working to fix. Please hang tight! 🏄
Slack,0,0,@JamesSLock Oh no! 🙈 Sorry for the grossness. What version of the iOS app are you currently using?
Slack,0,0,@ChrisCharabaruk For now, it is available in the direct download version: https://t.co/Rvzftwbhdb
Slack,0,0,@ChrisCharabaruk It's not something we've gotten around to implementing in the Windows Store app just yet. 📝 We'll pass the request across.
Slack,0,0,@aimee_ebooks Hmm, are you up-to-date or is it that new unread messages are not loading? 🕵️
Slack,0,0,@nickansel Ahh, you'd like to see the size of the GIF before you post it? Was it from an integration, an uploaded image, or URL?
Slack,0,0,@chrislorensson Head to https://t.co/dgHMiuFSdY to pick up a pair and support a great cause. 👌✨
Slack,0,0,@celsodantas We're really sorry for the hassle. 😔 We'll keep working on it! If you have any further trouble, please let us know.
Slack,1,0,@alpennec Thanks, Axel!
Slack,1,0,@agisilaosts Ugh, we're so sorry. Is this on desktop or mobile? Mac, Windows, Linux? Android or iOS?
Slack,1,0,@dougblackio We can sure consider it, thanks for the feedback! 🙇
Slack,1,0,@DavidMuroII That's quite the interesting thought. 💡 We'll definitely take the suggestion on board, thanks for reaching out! 🙇
Slack,1,0,@alpennec Too easy! We'll keep you posted. 💌
Slack,0,0,@celsodantas Sorry, friend. Please try swiping right-to-left to open the menu, then Settings > Advanced > Reset Cache. Does that help? 🤞
Slack,1,0,@picsoung Nifty! 🤖🎈
Slack,0,0,@DaleskaPr We're so sorry! Can you please try refreshing with ctrl/cmd + R if you're still experiencing troubles?
Slack,0,0,@djshiow Oh, the horror! 😱 Maybe a custom emoji in your status will fill the gaping void. https://t.co/Tly0GdV0H8
Slack,0,0,@jake_quade Nice! ⬛️⚪️🍃
Slack,1,0,@jake_quade Oh you flatterer, you! Do you have a fantastic custom theme? Share with the class! 🎨💻
Slack,0,0,@alex112269 Oh brilliant, we hope it helps! If not, just give us another shout and we'll lend a hand. 🔊
Slack,1,0,@sujdark Ooooh, great suggestion. We'll make a note of this for future development! In writing, for now. 😅
Slack,0,0,@CocoKur Hmm, we’re not quite sure what you’re looking for, but if you drop a note to feedback@slack.com we can see what we can share! 🙏
Slack,1,0,@jake_quade 🐱💭🌃💙
We'll let the team know that this is something you'd like to see. Thanks, Jake!
Slack,0,0,@MykeBates We'll consider it! However, this is something that's not likely to change any time soon, unfortunately. Sorry about that, Myke.
Slack,1,0,@alpennec Want us to tweet you when we have a fix? 🙏
Slack,0,0,@alpennec We apologize for the troubles here! We're looking into fixing this so that it requires fewer taps to answer on iOS.
Slack,1,0,@eggsbuttersugar Great feedback! We see how this would be helpful, and we'll pass your tweet along to our Mac desktop folks. 😉
Slack,1,0,@SuperTonic64 Not at the moment, sorry! Suggested statuses can only be set at the team level. 💁🏼
Slack,3,1,@RuePee @KristyT Ah, we're afraid that we won't be streaming or recording this event, but we're hoping to write a blog post post-event. ☺️
Slack,1,0,@ryanvarick Or were you looking to set unique DM notification preferences on a one-by-one basis, like you can do for channels?
Slack,0,0,@ryanvarick Hmm! You can set your notifications for DMs and keywords only. Does that work? It's under Preferences > Notifications.
Slack,1,0,@bobschwenkler @joy014 Pssst. We made this happen for you. Refresh your app with Cmd/Ctrl + R to play m4a files in Slack now. 😉
Slack,1,0,@iamtherealcmk Thanks for the suggestion! We see how one unified account would be supremely handy for you.
Slack,0,0,@teppo It's a bug! And it affects all audio files on iOS, not just WAV files. Sorry, we'll fix this – want us to tweet you when it's done?
Slack,0,0,@alex112269 Oh no, we're so sorry! Are you still having troubles? If so, which version of the app are you seeing this on? 🙏
Slack,0,0,@bobschwenkler @joy014 Ah, no, .m4a files aren't supported yet! Sorry, Bob. We'd like to offer this ability for .m4a files in the future.
Slack,0,0,@6byNine Ah, we see what you mean! Sorry for any confusion - we've passed this along to our team for a closer look! 👀
Slack,0,0,@MykeBates Not at the moment, we're afraid. We've only allowed certain widely-adopted services to display inline HTML and play media. 🙁
Slack,0,0,@mtjmelody Ack, are you referring to the "Find my Team" email? 😞
Slack,1,0,@NicholasNConrad Thanks for the suggestion! We see what you mean and we'll give it more thought. 🙇🏻
Slack,0,0,@f1xedgear Sorry about that! There's no way to turn it off, as Slackbot is designed to be a helper bot who responds to your messages. 😣
Slack,0,0,@BlnaryMlke That's fair. We'll keep noodling on how we can keep folks from different teams connected while preserving the team structure.
Slack,0,0,@kpfefferle We're afraid that's a desktop-only preference for now. Sorry about that, Kevin. Perhaps in the future. 😓
Slack,0,0,@sarbbottam You can check your team's Admins and Owners from https://t.co/Pixhy359hq > click on "view admins".
Slack,0,0,@sarbbottam For now, could you perhaps invite a team Admin (not necessarily an Owner) into the channel so they can archive it?
Slack,0,0,@sarbbottam Oof. We agree, that's bad. We're planning on fixing this.
Slack,0,0,@nileshtrivedi Oh! A team Admin or Owner will need to get in touch with us at feedback@slack.com to request a shared invite link first. 😉
Slack,0,0,@daphne_mir Oh, y'know. Mostly because of reasons. And stuff. 😇
Slack,1,0,@EM_marketing Could you kindly drop us a note at feedback@slack.com? Our Specialists would like to take a closer look at this! 💫🚀
Slack,0,0,@jugrand Time for a midnight snack! 🍧
Slack,0,0,@NotZombies 😕 Would you mind writing in to feedback@slack.com? We'd like to investigate this.
Slack,0,0,@lwaldal We see why it could be handy to automatically adjust this. Thanks for sharing this suggestion! 👍
Slack,0,0,@lwaldal The app should adjust the timing of your messages but adjusting your profile timezone is a manual step. 🙁
Slack,0,0,@terceravencida ¡Lo sentimos! ☹️ Mira al FAQ de PlusPlus: https://t.co/pGJvx2KB1D o los puedes contactar a ellos a support@plusplus.chat.
Slack,1,0,@alyssamazzina ...been no activity for the last week. We hope this helps! 🎀 2/2
Slack,1,0,@alyssamazzina Aha! A DM will be removed from your sidebar if there's no unread messages, it hasn't been opened lately, and there's... 1/2
Slack,1,0,@jayman Yuck. 🚫⚪️ Would you mind dropping us a message at feedback@slack.com so we can take a look under the hood?
Slack,0,0,@jshiplett We don’t have that data available, but we do listen to all user feedback. We’ll be happy to share your thoughts with the team. 🙇
Slack,0,0,@itsQuietEarp Sorry for the hassle! Check out this article from our Help Center for step-by-step instructions: https://t.co/FqmSyx2g39
Slack,2,0,@riklomas Ah, we see what you mean. We'll pass this onto the team for a look! 🔍👀
Slack,0,0,@aSloppyJo3 Jeepers, that sounds buggy. We'd like to investigate this – could you kindly drop us a line at feedback@slack.com? 💌🐛
Slack,0,0,@vasantkumar Noted! No plans to share at the moment, but we'll pass your thoughts to the team. Thanks for sending your feedback our way! 📚
Slack,0,0,@ParkerNielsen Oh, that would be wonderful! No plans to share at the moment but we'll let the team know you'd like to see this happen. 📸
Slack,0,0,@domurtag Sorry about that! If you head into your System Prefs > General and toggle your default browser, does that fix the issue?
Slack,0,0,@TheJoWo So if you have more than 10 active DMs going, Slack should keep them all open. Is that not happening for you?
Slack,0,0,@TheJoWo Looks like we had it wrong. Slack will display all recent active conversations and close DMs with no activity over time.
Slack,0,0,@daveixd @TrueHarlequin @DesignerHangout Turning that feature off is a team setting! Talk to an owner or admin: https://t.co/L15Q1EAh7K
Slack,0,0,@iservin 👍
Slack,0,0,@matthaggerty Oh dear! Could you please try resetting your cache, or dropping us a line? feedback@slack.com
Slack,0,0,@outlandishjosh  😱 Yikes! Are you able to connect to Slack via a browser?
Slack,0,0,@BlnaryMlke We're listening! While Slack is intended for closed work groups, we'll be happy to pass your feedback on.
Slack,0,0,@6byNine Each grey line under the date indicates a separate incident. Is that what you're referring to?
Slack,0,0,@sarbbottam Good grief, sorry for the frustration. Your Team Owner can change that setting at https://t.co/zFsyMlLi7M. 🌸
Slack,1,0,@ThatHarmanSingh Oh, that really would be easier to view for a long list of keywords. We'll pass that feedback along. Sorry! 🙏
Slack,0,0,@notthatnathan Yikes, sorry for the trouble! What version of the app are you running?
Slack,0,0,@KWarren Rats. Would you mind dropping us a note at feedback@slack.com some more investigation? 🤔📬
Slack,0,0,@ChrisCharabaruk Unfortunately this is not possible right now – but we hear you! That would be handy.
Slack,6,0,@LauraHayesDC :blush: We'll pass that along to her manager. 

(Or rather, to use first person for once, I'll pass t… https://t.co/1Np1eUeWNR
Slack,0,0,@openjck We definitely hear you. It's something we've discussed and certainly would make life easier if you're on multiple teams.
Slack,1,0,@LessIsMoi If you go into that channel and type `/rem
